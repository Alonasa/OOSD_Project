[???] and he [???] let us make man to our image and [???] and let 
him have [???] over the [???] of the [???] and the [???] of the [???] 
and the [???] and the whole [???] and every [???] creature that 
[???] upon the [???] 
 
let us make man to our [???] this image of god in [???] is not in the

[???] would have [???] but a [???] [???] them [???] 
for god had said the same words to the [???] and [???] [???] [???] who 
were incapable of receiving a [???] 
 
[???] and god [???] behold i have given you every herb bearing seed upon 
the [???] and all trees that have in themselves seed of their own [???] 
to be your [???] 
 
[???] and to all beasts of the [???] and to every fowl of the [???] and 
to all that move upon the [???] and wherein there is [???] that they

[???] and god saw all the things that he had [???] and they were very 
[???] and the evening and morning were the sixth [???] 
 
[???] chapter 2 
 
god [???] on the [???] day and [???] [???] the earthly [???] in 
which god [???] [???] he [???] him not to eat of the tree of 
[???] and [???] a woman of his [???] 
 
[???] so the heavens and the earth were [???] and all the furniture 
of [???] 
 
[???] and on the [???] day god ended his work which he had [???] and he 
[???] on the [???] day from all his work which he had [???] 
 
he [???] [???] that [???] he ceased to make or create any new kinds of 
[???] [???] as our lord tells [???] john [???] [???] still [???] 
[???] by [???] and [???] all [???] and [???] [???] 
 
[???] and he blessed the [???] [???] and [???] [???] because in it he 
had [???] from all his work which god created and [???] 
 
[???] these are the [???] of the heaven and the [???] when they 
were [???] in the day that the lord god made the heaven and the 
 
 
[???] and every plant of the field before it sprung up in the [???] and 
every herb of the ground before it [???] for the lord god had not [???] 
upon the [???] and there was not a man to till the [???] 
 
[???] but a spring rose out of the [???] [???] all the surface of the 
 
 
[???] and the lord god formed man of the [???] of the [???] and breathed 
into his face the breath of [???] and man became a living [???] 
 
[???] and the lord god had planted a paradise of pleasure from the 
[???] wherein he placed man whom he had [???] 
 
[???] and the lord god brought forth of the ground all manner of [???] 
fair to [???] and pleasant to eat [???] the tree of life also in the 
midst of [???] and the tree of knowledge of good and [???] 
 
the tree of [???] so called because it had that [???] that by 
eating of the fruit of [???] man would have been [???] in a constant 
state of [???] [???] and [???] and would not have died at [???] 
the tree of [???] to which the [???] serpent falsely 
[???] the power of [???] a [???] kind of [???] beyond 
that which god was pleased to [???] 
 
[???] and a river went out of the place of pleasure to water [???] 
which from thence is divided into four [???] 
 
[???] the name of the one is [???] that is it which [???] all the 
land of [???] where gold [???] 
 
[???] and the gold of that land is very [???] there is found [???] 
and the [???] [???] 
 
[???] and the name of the second river is [???] the same is it that 
[???] all the land of [???] 
 
[???] and the name of the third river is [???] the same [???] along 
by the [???] and the fourth river is [???] 
 
[???] and the lord god took [???] and put him into the paradise of 
[???] to dress [???] and to keep [???] 
 
[???] and he commanded [???] [???] of every tree of paradise thou shalt 
 
 
[???] but of the tree of knowledge of good and [???] thou shalt not [???] 
for in what day [???] thou shalt eat of [???] thou shalt die the [???] 
 
[???] and the lord god [???] it is not good for man to be [???] let us 
make him a help like unto [???] 
 
[???] and the lord god having formed out of the ground all the beasts of 
the [???] and all the [???] of the [???] brought them to adam to see 
what he would call [???] for whatsoever adam called any living creature 
the same is its [???] 
 
[???] and adam called all the beasts by their [???] and all the [???] 
of the [???] and all the cattle of the [???] but for adam there was not 
found a [???] like [???] 
 
[???] then the lord god cast a deep sleep upon [???] and when he was 
fast [???] he took one of his [???] and filled up flesh for [???] 
 
[???] and the lord god built the rib which he took from adam into a 
[???] and brought her to [???] 
 
[???] and adam [???] this now is bone of my [???] and flesh of my 
[???] she shall be called [???] because she was taken out of [???] 
 
[???] wherefore a man shall leave father and [???] and shall [???] to 
his [???] and they shall be two in one [???] 
 
[???] and they were both [???] to [???] adam and his [???] and were not 
 
 
[???] chapter 3 
 
the [???] [???] the fall of our first [???] their [???] 
the promise of a [???] 
 
[???] now the serpent was more subtle than any of the beasts of the earth 
which the lord god had [???] and he said to the [???] why hath god 
commanded [???] that you should not eat of every tree of [???] 
 
[???] and the woman answered [???] [???] of the fruit of the trees that 
are in paradise we do [???] 
 
[???] but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of [???] god 
hath commanded us that we should not [???] and that we should not touch 
[???] lest perhaps we [???] 
 
[???] and the serpent said to the [???] [???] you shall not die the [???] 
 
[???] for god doth know that in what day [???] you shall eat [???] 
your eyes shall be [???] and you shall be as [???] knowing good and 
 
 
[???] and the woman saw that the tree was good to [???] and fair to the 
[???] and [???] to [???] and she took of the fruit [???] and 
did [???] and gave to her [???] who did [???] 
 
[???] and the eyes of them both were [???] and when they perceived 
themselves to be [???] they [???] together fig [???] and made 
themselves [???] 
 
and the [???] [???] not that they were blind [???] [???] the woman saw 
that the tree was fair to the [???] [???] [???] nor yet that their eyes 
were opened to any more perfect knowledge of [???] but only to the 
unhappy experience of having lost the good of original grace and 
[???] and [???] the dreadful evil of [???] from whence followed a 
shame of their being [???] which they minded not [???] because being 
now [???] of original [???] they quickly began to be subject to the 
shameful [???] of the [???] 
 
[???] and when they heard the voice of the lord god walking in paradise 
at the afternoon [???] adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of 
the lord [???] [???] the trees of [???] 
 
[???] and the lord god called [???] and said to [???] where art [???] 
 
[???] and he [???] i heard thy voice in [???] and i was [???] 
because i was [???] and i hid [???] 
 
[???] and he said to [???] and who hath told thee that thou wast [???] 
but that thou hast eaten of the tree whereof i commanded thee that thou 
shouldst not [???] 
 
[???] and adam [???] the [???] whom thou [???] me to be my [???] 
gave me of the [???] and i did [???] 
 
[???] and the lord god said to the [???] why hast thou done [???] and 
she [???] the serpent deceived [???] and i did [???] 
 
[???] and the lord god said to the [???] because thou hast done this 
[???] thou art cursed among all [???] and beasts of the [???] upon 
thy breast shalt thou [???] and earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy 
 
 
[???] i will put [???] between thee and the [???] and thy seed and 
her [???] she shall crush thy [???] and thou shalt lie in wait for her 
 
 
she shall [???] [???] the [???] so divers of the fathers read this 
[???] [???] to the [???] others read it [???] [???] the [???] 
the sense is the [???] for it is by her [???] [???] [???] that the 
woman [???] the [???] [???] 
 
[???] to the woman also he [???] i will [???] thy [???] and thy 
[???] in sorrow shalt thou bring forth [???] and thou shalt 
be under thy [???] [???] and he shall have [???] over [???] 
 
[???] and to adam he [???] because thou hast [???] to the voice of 
thy [???] and hast eaten of the [???] whereof i commanded [???] that 
thou shouldst not [???] cursed is the earth in thy [???] with labour and 
toil shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy [???] 
 
[???] thorns and [???] shall it bring forth to [???] and thou shalt 
eat the herbs of the [???] 
 
[???] in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to 
the earth out of which thou wast [???] for dust thou [???] and into dust 
thou shalt [???] 
 
[???] and adam called the name of his wife [???] because she was the 
mother of all the [???] 
 
[???] and the lord god made for adam and his wife garments of [???] and 
[???] [???] 
 
[???] and he [???] behold adam is become as one of [???] knowing good and 
[???] now therefore lest perhaps he put forth his hand and take also of 
the tree of [???] and [???] and live for [???] 
 
behold [???] [???] this was spoken by way of [???] him with his 
[???] in [???] a knowledge that might make him like to [???] 
 
[???] and the lord god sent him out of the paradise of [???] to till 
the earth from which he was [???] 
 
[???] and he cast out [???] and placed before the paradise of pleasure 
[???] and a [???] [???] turning every [???] to keep the way of 
the tree of [???] 
 
[???] chapter 4 
 
the history of [???] and [???] 
 
[???] and adam knew eve his [???] who [???] and brought forth [???] 
[???] i have [???] a man through [???] 
 
[???] and again she brought forth his brother [???] and [???] was a 
[???] and [???] a [???] 
 
[???] and it came to pass after many [???] that [???] [???] of the 
[???] of the [???] gifts to the [???] 
 
[???] [???] also offered of the [???] of his [???] and of their [???] 
and the lord had respect to [???] and to his [???] 
 
had [???] that [???] [???] his acceptance of his sacrifice [???] 
coming from a heart full of [???] and [???] as we may [???] by 
some [???] [???] such as sending fire from heaven upon his [???] 
 
[???] but to [???] and his [???] he had no [???] and [???] was 
exceeding [???] and his countenance [???] 
 
[???] and the lord said to [???] why art thou [???] and why is thy 
countenance [???] 
 
[???] if thou do [???] shalt thou not [???] but if [???] shall not sin 
forthwith be present at the [???] but the lust thereof shall be under 
[???] and thou shalt have [???] over [???] 
 
[???] and [???] said to [???] his [???] let us go forth [???] and when 
they were in the [???] [???] rose up against his brother [???] and slew 
 
 
[???] and the lord said to [???] where is thy brother [???] and he 
[???] i know [???] am i my [???] [???] 
 
[???] and he said to [???] what hast thou [???] the voice of thy 
[???] blood [???] to me from the [???] 
 
[???] now therefore cursed shalt thou be upon the [???] which hath 
opened her mouth and received the blood of thy brother at thy [???] 
 
[???] when thou shalt till [???] it shall not yield to thee its [???] a 
[???] and a [???] shalt thou be upon the [???] 
 
[???] and [???] said to the [???] my iniquity is greater than that i may 
deserve [???] 
 
[???] behold thou dost cast me out this day from the face of the [???] 
and from thy face i shall be [???] and i shall be a [???] and a 
[???] on the [???] every one therefore that [???] [???] shall kill 
 
 
every one that [???] me shall kill [???] his guilty conscience made 
him fear his own brothers and [???] of [???] by this [???] there might 
be a good number upon the [???] which had now endured near [???] [???] 
as may be [???] from [???] [???] [???] with [???] [???] though in 
the [???] account given in the [???] only [???] and [???] are 
 
 
[???] and the lord said to [???] [???] it shall not so [???] but [???] 
shall kill [???] shall be [???] [???] and the lord set a mark 
upon [???] that [???] found him should not kill [???] 
 
set a [???] [???] the more common opinion of the [???] of holy 
writ [???] this mark to have been a trembling of the [???] or a 
horror and [???] in his [???]

[???] with such [???] in the beginning of the [???] as mankind 
could not otherwise be [???] he built a [???] [???] in process of

[???] [???] hath taken away all that was our [???] and being 
[???] by his substance is become [???] 
 
[???] and [???] [???] that [???] countenance was not towards him 
as yesterday and the other [???] 
 
[???] especially the lord saying to [???] return into the land of thy 
fathers and to thy [???] and i will be with [???] 
 
[???] he [???] and called [???] and [???] into the [???] where he fed 
the [???] 
 
[???] and said to [???] i see your [???] countenance is not towards 
me as yesterday and the other [???] but the god of my father hath been 
with [???] 
 
[???] and you know that i have served your father to the [???] of my 
 
 
[???] yea your father hath also [???] [???] and hath changed my 
wages ten [???] and yet god hath not suffered him to hurt [???] 
 
[???] if at any [???] he [???] the [???] shall be thy [???] all the 
sheep brought forth [???] but when he said on the [???] thou 
shalt take all the white one for thy [???] all the [???] brought forth 
white [???] 
 
[???] and god hath taken your [???] [???] and given it to [???] 
 
[???] for after the time came of the [???] [???] i lifted up my 
[???] and saw in my [???] that the [???] which [???] upon the [???] 
were of divers [???] and [???] and [???] 
 
[???] and the angel of god said to me in my [???] [???] and i 
[???] here i [???] 
 
[???] and he [???] lift up thy [???] and see that all the [???] [???] 
upon the [???] are of divers [???] spotted and [???] for i 
have seen all that [???] hath done to [???] 
 
[???] i am the god of [???] where thou didst [???] the [???] and 
make a vow to [???] now therefore [???] and go out of this [???] and 
return into thy native [???] 
 
[???] and [???] and [???] [???] have we any thing left among the 
goods and inheritance of our [???] [???] 
 
[???] hath he not [???] us as [???] and sold [???] and eaten up 
the price of [???] 
 
[???] but god hath taken our [???] [???] and delivered them to [???] 
and to our [???] [???] do all that god hath commanded [???] 
 
[???] then [???] rose [???] and having set his children and wives upon 
[???] went his [???] 
 
[???] and he took all his [???] and [???] and whatsoever he had 
[???] in [???] and went forward to [???] his [???] to the 
land of [???] 
 
[???] at that time [???] was gone to [???] his [???] and [???] stole 
away her [???] [???] 
 
her [???] [???] by this it appears that [???] was an [???] and 
some of the fathers are of opinion that [???] stole away these [???] to 
withdraw him from [???] [???] the occasion of his [???] 
 
[???] and [???] would not confess to his [???] that he was 
flying [???] 
 
[???] and when he was [???] together with all that [???] to [???] and 
having passed the [???] was going on towards mount [???] 
 
[???] it was told [???] on the third [???] that [???] [???] 
 
[???] and he took his brethren with [???] and pursued after him seven 
[???] and [???] him in the mount of [???] 
 
[???] and he saw in a dream [???] saying to [???] take heed thou speak 
not any thing [???] against [???] 
 
[???] now [???] had [???] his tent in the [???] and when [???] with 
his [???] had [???] [???] he [???] his tent in the same mount 
of [???] 
 
[???] and he said to [???] why hast thou done [???] to carry [???] 
without my [???] my daughters as [???] taken with the [???] 
 
[???] why wouldst thou run away [???] and not acquaint [???] that i 
might have brought thee on the way with [???] and with [???] and with 
[???] and with [???] 
 
[???] thou hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and [???] thou 
hast done [???] and now [???] 
 
[???] it is in my power to return thee [???] but the god of your father 
said to me [???] take heed thou speak not any thing [???] against 
 
 
[???] suppose thou didst desire to go to thy [???] and hadst a 
longing after thy [???] [???] why hast thou stolen away my [???] 
 
[???] [???] [???] that i departed unknown to [???] it was for fear 
lest thou wouldst take away thy daughters by [???] 
 
[???] [???] [???] thou [???] me with [???] with [???] thou 
shalt find thy [???] let him be slain before our [???] [???] and 
if thou find any of thy things with [???] take them [???] now when he said 
[???] he knew not that [???] had stolen the [???] 
 
[???] so [???] went into the tent of [???] and of [???] and of both the 
[???] and found them [???] and when he was entered into [???] 
 
 
[???] [???] in [???] hid the [???] under the [???] [???] and sat 
upon [???] and when he had [???] all the [???] and found [???] 
 
[???] she [???] let not my lord be angry that i cannot rise up before 
[???] because it has now happened to me according to the custom of 
[???] so his careful search was in [???]

[???] and when they saw him afar [???] before he came nigh [???] they 
thought to kill [???]

into [???] that [???] into [???] the place where the souls of the just 
were received before the death of our [???] for [???] that the 
word hell sometimes is taken for the [???] it cannot be so taken in 
this [???] since [???] did not believe his son to be in the [???]

[???] after [???] it came to [???] that two [???] the [???] and the 
[???] of the king of [???] offended their [???] 
 
[???] and [???] being angry with [???] [???] the one was chief [???] 
the other chief [???] 
 
[???] he sent them to the prison of the commander of the [???] in 
which joseph also was [???] 
 
[???] but the keeper of the prison delivered them to [???] and he 
served [???] some little time [???] and they were kept in [???] 
 
[???] and they both [???] a dream the same [???] according to the 
[???] [???] to [???] 
 
[???] and when joseph was come into them in the [???] and saw them 
 
 
[???] he asked [???] [???] why is your countenance [???] today than 
 
 
[???] they [???] we have [???] a [???] and there is nobody to 
[???] it to [???] and joseph said to [???] doth not [???] 
belong to [???] tell me what you have [???] 
 
doth not [???] belong to [???] when dreams are from [???] as 
these [???] the [???] of them is a gift of [???] but the 
[???] of dreams are not of this [???] but either proceed from the 
natural [???] and [???] of [???] or the [???] of their 
[???] in the day on such objects as they are much affected [???] 
or from their mind being disturbed with cares and [???] and 
oppressed with [???] [???] or they are suggested by evil 
[???] to [???] or to [???] weak [???] in order to gain [???] 
and so draw them into error or [???] or at least to trouble them 
in their [???] whom they cannot move when they are [???] so that the 
general [???] with regard to [???] is not to observe [???] nor to give 
any credit to [???] 
 
[???] the chief [???] first told his [???] i saw before me a [???] 
 
[???] on which were three [???] which by little and little sent out 
[???] and after the [???] brought forth ripe [???] 
 
[???] and the cup of [???] was in my [???] and i took the [???] and 
pressed them into the cup which i [???] and i gave the cup to [???] 
 
[???] joseph [???] this is the [???] of the [???] the 
three [???] are yet three [???] 
 
[???] after which [???] will remember thy [???] and will restore 
thee to thy former [???] and thou shalt present him the cup according 
to thy [???] as before thou was wont to [???] 
 
[???] only remember me when it shall be well with [???] and do me this 
[???] to put [???] in mind to take me out of this [???] 
 
[???] for i was stolen away out of the land of the [???] and here 
without any fault was cast into the [???] 
 
[???] the chief [???] seeing that he had wisely [???] the [???] 
[???] i also [???] a [???] that i had three [???] of meal upon my 
 
 
[???] and that in one basket which was [???] i carried all [???] 
that are made by the art of [???] and that the birds ate out of [???] 
 
[???] joseph [???] this is the [???] of the [???] the 
three [???] are yet three [???] 
 
[???] after which [???] will take thy head from [???] and hang thee on 
a [???] and the birds shall tear thy [???] 
 
[???] the third day after this was the [???] of [???] and he made 
a great feast for his [???] and at the banquet remembered the chief 
[???] and the chief [???] 
 
[???] and he [???] the one to his [???] to present him the [???] 
 
[???] the other he hanged on a [???] that the truth of the 
[???] might be [???] 
 
[???] but the chief [???] when things [???] with [???] forgot his 
 
 
[???] chapter [???] 
 
joseph [???] the two dreams of [???] he is made [???] over all 
 
 
[???] after two years [???] had a [???] he thought he stood by the 
 
 
[???] out of which came up seven [???] very beautiful and [???] and they 
fed in [???] [???] 
 
[???] other seven also came up out of the [???] [???] and lean 
[???] and they fed on the very bank of the [???] in green [???] 
 
[???] and they [???] [???] whose bodies were very beautiful and well 
[???] so [???] [???] 
 
[???] he slept [???] and [???] another [???] seven ears of corn came 
up upon one stalk full and [???] 
 
[???] then seven other ears sprung up thin and [???] 
 
[???] and [???] all the beauty of the [???] [???] [???] after his 
 
 
[???] and when morning was [???] being struck with [???] he sent to all 
the [???] of [???] and to all the wise [???] and they being 
called [???] he told them his [???] and there was not any one that could 
[???] [???] 
 
[???] then at length the chief [???] [???] [???] i confess my 
 
 
[???] the king being angry with his [???] commanded me and the 
chief [???] to be cast into the prison of the captain of the [???] 
 
[???] where in one night both of us [???] a dream [???] things to 
 
 
[???] there was there a young man a [???] servant to the same captain 
of the [???] to whom we told our [???] 
 
[???] and we heard what afterwards the event of the thing proved to be 
[???] for i was [???] to my [???] and he was hanged upon a [???] 
 
[???] forthwith at the [???] command joseph was brought out of the 
[???] and they [???] [???] and changing his apparel brought him in to 
 
 
[???] and he said to [???] i have [???] [???] and there is no one 
that can [???] [???] now i have heard that thou art very wise at 
[???] [???] 
 
[???] joseph [???] without [???] god shall give [???] a prosperous 
 
 
[???] so [???] told what he had [???] methought i stood upon the 
bank of the [???] 
 
[???] and seven [???] came up out of the [???] exceeding beautiful and 
full of [???] and they [???] on green places in a [???] [???] 
 
[???] and [???] there followed [???] other seven [???] so very [???] 
favoured and [???] that i never saw the like in the land of [???] 
 
[???] and they [???] and [???] the [???] 
 
[???] and yet gave no mark of their being [???] but were as lean and 
[???] as [???] i [???] and then fell asleep [???] 
 
[???] and [???] a [???] seven ears of corn grew up upon one [???] 
full and very [???] 
 
[???] other seven also thin and [???] sprung of the [???] 
 
[???] and they [???] the beauty of the [???] i told this dream to 
the [???] and there is no man that can [???] [???] 
 
[???] joseph [???] the [???] dream is [???] god hath [???] to 
[???] what he is about to [???] 
 
[???] the seven beautiful [???] and the seven full [???] are seven 
years of [???] and both contain the same meaning of the [???] 
 
[???] and the seven lean and thin [???] that came up after [???] and the 
seven thin ears that were [???] with the burning [???] are seven years 
of [???] to [???] 
 
[???] which shall be [???] in this [???] 
 
[???] [???] there shall come seven years of great plenty in the whole 
land of [???] 
 
[???] after which shall follow other seven years of so great [???] 
that all the abundance before shall be [???] for the [???] shall 
[???] all the [???] 
 
[???] and the greatness of the [???] shall destroy the greatness of 
the [???] 
 
[???] and for that thou didst see the second time a dream [???] to 
the same [???] it is a token of the [???] and that the word of god 
[???] to [???] and is [???] [???] 
 
[???] now therefore let the king provide a wise and [???] [???] 
and make him [???] over the land of [???] 
 
[???] that he may appoint [???] over all the [???] and gather 
into [???] the fifth part of the [???] during the seven fruitful 
 
 
[???] that shall now presently [???] and let all the corn be laid [???] 
under [???] [???] and be reserved in the [???] 
 
[???] and let it be in [???] against the [???] of seven years to 
[???] which shall oppress [???] and the land shall not be [???] with 
 
 
[???] the counsel pleased [???] and all his [???] 
 
[???] and he said to [???] can we find such another [???] that is full 
of the spirit of [???] 
 
[???] he said therefore to [???] seeing god hath [???] thee all that 
thou hast [???] can i find one wiser and one like unto [???] 
 
[???] thou shalt be over my [???] and at the commandment of thy mouth 
all the people shall [???] only in the kingly throne will i be above 
 
 
[???] and again [???] said to [???] [???] i have appointed thee 
over the whole land of [???] 
 
[???] and he took his ring from his own [???] and gave it into his 
[???] and he put upon him a robe of [???] and put a chain of gold about 
his [???] 
 
[???] and he made him go up into his second [???] the [???] 
[???] that all should bow their knee before [???] and that they 
should know he was made governor over the whole land of [???] 
 
[???] and the king said to [???] i am [???] without thy commandment 
no man shall move hand or foot in all the land of [???]

[???] and his sons are presented before [???] he [???] them the land 
of [???] the [???] [???] the [???] to sell all their 
[???] to the [???] 
 
[???] then joseph went in and told [???] [???] my father and 
[???] their sheep and their [???] and all that they [???] are 
come out of the land of [???] and behold they stay in the land of 
 
 
[???] five men [???] the last of his [???] he presented before the 
 
 
the [???] some [???] this word of the [???] and most 
[???] but joseph seems rather to have chosen out such as had the 
meanest [???] that [???] might not think of [???] them at 
[???] with danger of their [???] and [???] 
 
[???] and he asked [???] what is your [???] they [???] [???] thy 
[???] are [???] both we and our [???] 
 
[???] we are come to [???] in thy [???] because there is no grass for 
the [???] of thy [???] the [???] being very grievous in the land 
of [???] and we pray thee to give orders that we thy servants may be 
in the land of [???] 
 
[???] the king therefore said to [???] thy father and thy brethren are 
come to [???] 
 
[???] the land of egypt is before [???] and make them dwell in the best 
[???] and give them the land of [???] and if thou knowest that there 
are [???] men among [???] make them [???] over my [???] 
 
[???] after this joseph brought in his father to the [???] and presented 
him before [???] and he blessed [???] 
 
[???] and being asked by [???] how many are the days of the years of thy 
 
 
[???] he [???] the days of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty 
[???] [???] and [???] and they are not come up to the days of the 
pilgrimage of my [???] 
 
[???] and blessing the [???] he went [???] 
 
[???] but joseph gave a possession to his father and his brethren in 
[???] in the best place of the [???] in [???] as [???] had 
 
 
[???] and he [???] [???] and all his [???] [???] [???] food 
to every [???] 
 
[???] for in the whole world there was want of [???] and a [???] had 
oppressed the [???] more especially of egypt and [???] 
 
[???] out of which he [???] up all the money for the corn which they 
[???] and brought it in to the [???] [???] 
 
[???] and when the [???] wanted [???] all egypt came to [???] 
[???] give us [???] why should we die in thy [???] having now no 
 
 
[???] and he answered [???] bring me your [???] and for them i will 
give you [???] if you have no [???] 
 
[???] and when they had brought [???] he gave them food in exchange for 
their [???] and [???] and [???] and [???] and he [???] them 
that year for the exchange of their [???] 
 
[???] and they came the second [???] and said to [???] we will not hide 
from our [???] how that our money is [???] and our cattle also are 
[???] neither art thou ignorant that we have nothing now left but our 
bodies and our [???] 
 
[???] why therefore shall we die before thy [???] we will be [???] 
both we and our [???] buy us to be the [???] [???] and give us 
[???] lest for want of [???] the land be turned into a [???] 
 
[???] so joseph bought all the land of [???] every man [???] his 
[???] because of the greatness of the [???] and he brought it 
into [???] [???] 
 
[???] and all its people from one end of the [???] of [???] even to 
the other end [???] 
 
[???] except the land of the [???] which had been given them by the 
[???] to whom also a certain allowance of food was given out of the 
public [???] and therefore they were not forced to sell their 
 
 
[???] then joseph said to the [???] [???] as you [???] both you and 
your lands belong to [???] take seed and sow the [???] 
 
[???] that you may have [???] the fifth part you shall give to the 
[???] the other four you shall have for [???] and for food for your 
[???] and [???] 
 
[???] and they [???] our life is in thy [???] only let my lord look 
[???] upon [???] and we will gladly serve the [???] 
 
[???] from that time unto this [???] in the whole land of [???] the 
fifth part is paid to the [???] and it is become as a [???] except the 
land of the [???] which was free from this [???] 
 
[???] so [???] [???] in [???] that [???] in the land of [???] and 
possessed [???] and [???] and was [???] [???] 
 
[???] and he lived in it [???] [???] and all the days of his life 
came to a hundred and [???] [???] 
 
[???] and when he saw that the day of his death drew [???] he called 
his son [???] and said to [???] if i have found favour in thy [???] 
put thy hand under my [???] and thou shalt [???] me this kindness and 
[???] not to bury me in [???] 
 
[???] but i will sleep with my [???] and thou shalt take me away out 
of this [???] and bury me in the [???] place of my [???] and 
joseph answered [???] i will do what thou hast [???] 
 
[???] and he [???] swear then to [???] and as he was [???] [???] 
[???] [???] turning to the [???] [???] 
 
to the [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] following the greek 
[???] of the [???] reads [???] the top of his [???] where 
[???] that the same word in the [???] according to the different 
pointing of [???] [???] both a bed and a [???] and to [???] both these 
[???] we must understand that [???] leaning on [???] rod [???] 
turning towards the head of his [???] which [???] [???] as it was 
referred to [???] was an absolute and sovereign [???] but [???] as 
it was referred to the rod of [???] as a figure of the [???] that 
[???] of the royal dignity of [???] was only an inferior and [???]

[???] [???] 
 
[???] and said to his [???] i am not [???] of seeing [???] moreover 
god hath [???] me thy [???] 
 
[???] and when joseph had taken them from his [???] [???] he [???]

[???] [???] [???] [???] [???] 
 
[???] [???] [???] and [???] 
 
[???] [???] and [???] gad and [???] 
 
[???] and all the souls that came out of [???] [???] were [???] but 
joseph was in [???] 
 
[???] after he was [???] and all his [???] and all that [???] 
 
[???] the children of [???] [???] and sprung up into [???] 
and growing exceedingly strong they filled the [???] 
 
[???] in the mean time there arose a new king over [???] that knew not 
 
 
[???] and he said to his [???] behold the people of the children of

[???] come let us wisely oppress [???] lest they [???] and if any 
war shall rise against [???] join with our [???] and having overcome 
[???] depart out of the [???] 
 
[???] therefore he set over them masters of the [???] to afflict them 
with [???] and they built for [???] cities of [???] [???] 
and [???] 
 
of [???] [???] of [???] 
 
[???] but the more they oppressed [???] the more they were [???]

[???] and the [???] hated the children of [???] and [???] them 
and [???] [???] 
 
[???] and they made their life bitter with hard works in clay and [???] 
and with all manner of [???] wherewith they were [???] in the

[???] they [???] the [???] women are not as the egyptian [???] for 
they themselves are [???] in the office of a [???] and they are

[???] and grew exceedingly [???] 
 
[???] and because the [???] feared [???] he built them [???] 
 
because the [???] feared [???] [???] the [???] were [???] not

fourth is of [???] [???] again [???] to dismiss the [???] but 
doth it [???] 
 
[???] and the lord said to [???] go in to [???] and thou shalt say to 
[???] thus [???] the [???] let my people go to sacrifice to [???] 
 
[???] but if thou wilt not let them [???] behold i will strike all thy

[???] and the river shall bring forth an abundance of [???] which shall 
come up and enter into thy [???] and thy [???] and upon thy [???]

[???] and into the remains of thy [???] 
 
[???] and the [???] shall come in to [???] and to thy [???] and to all 
thy [???] 
 
[???] and the lord said to [???] say to [???] stretch forth thy hand 
upon the [???] and upon the rivers and the [???] and bring forth 
[???] upon the land of [???] 
 
[???] and aaron [???] forth his hand upon the waters of [???] and 
the [???] came [???] and covered the land of [???] 
 
[???] and the [???] [???] by their [???] did in like [???] 
and they brought forth [???] upon the land of [???] 
 
[???] but [???] called [???] and [???] and said to [???] pray ye to the 
lord to take away the [???] from me and from my [???] and i will let 
the people go to sacrifice to the [???] 
 
pray ye to the [???] [???] by this it [???] that though the 
[???] by the help of the [???] could bring [???] yet they could 
not take them [???] god being pleased to [???] in this the power of 
[???] so we see they could not afterwards produce the lesser [???] 
and in this restraint of the power of the [???] were forced to 
acknowledge the finger of [???] 
 
[???] and [???] said to [???] set me a time when i shall pray for [???] 
and for thy [???] and for thy [???] that the [???] may be driven 
away from thee and from thy [???] and from thy [???] and from thy 
[???] and may remain only in the [???] 
 
[???] and he [???] to [???] but he [???] i will do according to 
thy [???] that thou [???] know that there is none like to the lord our 
 
 
[???] and the [???] shall depart from [???] and from thy [???] and from 
thy [???] and from thy [???] and shall remain only in the [???] 
 
[???] and [???] and aaron went forth from [???] and [???] cried to the 
lord for the [???] which he had made to [???] concerning the [???] 
 
[???] and the lord did according to the word of [???] and the [???] 
died out of the [???] and out of the [???] and out of the [???] 
 
[???] and they [???] them together into [???] [???] and the land 
was [???] 
 
[???] and [???] seeing that rest was [???] [???] his own [???] and 
did not hear [???] as the lord had [???] 
 
[???] [???] his own [???] by this we see that [???] was himself 
the [???] cause of his heart being [???] and not [???] the 
same repeated in [???] [???] [???] [???] his heart at this time [???] 
likewise [???] [???] [???] and [???] [???] 
 
[???] and the lord said to [???] say to [???] stretch forth thy [???] 
and strike the dust of the [???] and may there be [???] in all the 
land of [???] 
 
[???] or [???] [???] [???] small flying [???] very 
[???] both to men and [???] 
 
[???] and they did [???] and aaron [???] forth his [???] holding the 
[???] and he struck the dust of the [???] and there came [???] on men 
and on [???] all the dust of the earth was turned into [???] 
through all the land of [???] 
 
[???] and the [???] with their [???] [???] in like 
[???] to bring forth [???] and they could [???] and there were 
[???] as well on men as on [???] 
 
[???] and the [???] said to [???] this is the finger of [???] and 
[???] heart was [???] and he [???] not unto [???] as the lord 
had [???] 
 
[???] the lord also said to [???] arise [???] and stand before [???] 
for he will go forth to the [???] and thou shalt say to [???] thus 
[???] the [???] let my people go to sacrifice to [???] 
 
[???] but if thou wilt not let them [???] behold i will send in upon [???] 
and upon thy [???] and upon thy [???] all kind of [???] and the 
houses of the [???] shall be filled with flies of divers [???] and 
the whole land wherein they shall [???] 
 
[???] and i will make the land of [???] wonderful in that [???] so that 
flies shall not be [???] and thou shalt know that i am the lord in the 
midst of the [???] 
 
[???] and i will put a division between my people and thy [???] to 
morrow shall this sign [???] 
 
[???] and the lord did [???] and there came a very grievous [???] of flies 
into the houses of [???] and of his [???] and into all the land of 
[???] and the land was corrupted by this kind of [???] 
 
[???] and [???] called [???] and [???] and said to [???] go and 
sacrifice to your god in this [???] 
 
[???] and [???] [???] it cannot be [???] for we shall sacrifice the 
[???] of the [???] to the lord our [???] now if we kill those 
things which the [???] [???] in their [???] they will stone 
 
 
the [???] [???] that [???] the things they worship for [???] 
[???] [???] [???] it is the usual style of the [???] to call all 
[???] and false [???] [???] to signify how much the people of 
god ought to detest and abhor [???] 
 
[???] we will go three [???] journey into the [???] and we will 
sacrifice to the lord our [???] as he hath commanded [???] 
 
[???] and [???] [???] i will let you go to sacrifice to the lord your 
god in the [???] but go no [???] pray for [???] 
 
[???] and [???] [???] i will go out from [???] and will pray to the 
[???] and the flies shall depart from [???] and from his [???] and 
from his people to [???] but do not deceive any [???] in not [???] 
the people go to sacrifice to the [???] 
 
[???] so [???] went out from [???] and [???] to the [???] 
 
[???] and he did according to his [???] and he took away the flies from 
[???] and from his [???] and from his [???] there was not left 
so much as [???] 
 
[???] and [???] heart was [???] so that neither this time would 
he let the people [???]

[???] and the lord said to [???] go in to [???] and speak to [???] thus 
[???] the lord god of the [???] let my people go to sacrifice to [???] 
 
[???] but if thou [???] and withhold them [???] 
 
[???] behold my hand shall be upon thy [???] and a very grievous 
[???] upon thy [???] and [???] and [???] and [???] and [???] 
 
[???] and the lord will make a wonderful difference between the 
[???] of [???] and the [???] of the [???] that nothing 
at all shall die of those things that belong to the children of [???] 
 
[???] and the lord appointed a [???] [???] to morrow will the lord do 
this thing in the [???] 
 
[???] the lord therefore did this thing the next [???] and all the beasts 
of the [???] [???] but of the beasts of the children of [???] there 
died not [???] 
 
all the [???] that [???] many of all [???] 
 
[???] and [???] sent to [???] and there was not any thing dead of that 
which [???] [???] and [???] heart was [???] and he did not 
let the people [???] 
 
[???] and the lord said to [???] and [???] take to you [???] of ashes 
out of the [???] and let [???] [???] it in the air in the presence 
of [???] 
 
[???] and be there dust upon all the land of [???] for there shall be 
[???] and swelling [???] both in men and [???] in the whole land of 
 
 
[???] and they took ashes out of the [???] and stood before [???] 
and [???] [???] it in the [???] and there came [???] with swelling 
[???] in men and [???] 
 
[???] neither could the [???] stand before [???] for the [???] that 
were upon [???] and in all the land of [???] 
 
 
[???] and the lord [???] [???] [???] and he [???] not unto 
[???] as the lord had spoken to [???] 
 
[???] [???] see the [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] and 
[???] [???] 
 
[???] and the lord said to [???] arise in the [???] and stand before 
[???] and thou shalt say to [???] thus [???] the [???] the god of the 
[???] let my people go to sacrifice to [???] 
 
[???] for i will at this time send all my plagues upon thy [???] and 
upon thy [???] and upon thy [???] that thou mayst know that there 
is none like me in all the [???] 
 
[???] for now i will stretch out my hand to strike [???] and thy [???] 
with [???] and thou shalt perish from the [???] 
 
[???] and therefore have i raised [???] that i may [???] my power in 
[???] and my name may be spoken of throughout all the [???] 
 
[???] dost thou yet hold back my [???] and wilt thou not let them [???] 
 
[???] behold i will cause it to rain to morrow at this same [???] an 
exceeding great [???] such as hath not been in egypt from the day that 
it was [???] until this present [???] 
 
[???] send therefore now [???] and gather together thy [???] and 
all that thou hast in the [???] for men and [???] and all things that 
shall be found [???] and not [???] together out of the fields which 
the hail shall fall [???] shall [???] 
 
[???] he that feared the word of the lord among [???] [???] made 
his servants and his cattle [???] into [???] 
 
[???] but he that regarded not the word of the [???] left his [???] 
and his cattle in the [???] 
 
[???] and the lord said to [???] stretch forth thy hand towards [???] 
that there may be hail in the whole land of egypt upon [???] and upon 
[???] and upon every herb of the field in the land of [???] 
 
[???] and [???] [???] forth his rod towards [???] and the lord 
sent thunder and [???] and [???] running along the [???] and the 
lord [???] hail upon the land of [???] 
 
[???] and the hail and fire [???] with it drove on [???] and it was 
of so great [???] as never before was seen in the whole land of egypt 
since that nation was [???] 
 
[???] and the hail destroyed through all the land of egypt all things 
that were in the [???] both man and [???] and the hail [???] every 
herb of the [???] and it broke every tree of the [???] 
 
[???] only in the land of [???] where the children of [???] [???] the 
hail fell [???] 
 
[???] and [???] sent and called [???] and [???] saying to [???] i have 
[???] this time [???] the lord is [???] i and my [???] are [???] 
 
[???] pray ye to the lord that the [???] of god and the hail may 
[???] that i may let you [???] and that ye may stay here no [???] 
 
[???] [???] [???] as soon as i am gone out of the [???] i will stretch 
forth my hands to the [???] and the [???] shall [???] and the hail 
shall be no [???] that thou mayst know that the earth is the [???] 
 
[???] but i know that neither [???] nor thy servants do yet fear the 
lord [???] 
 
[???] the [???] [???] and the barley were [???] because the barley 
was [???] and the [???] was now [???] 
 
[???] but the [???] and other winter corn were not [???] because they 
were [???] 
 
[???] and when [???] was gone from [???] out of the [???] he [???] 
forth his hands to the [???] and the [???] and the hail [???] 
neither did there drop any more rain upon the [???] 
 
[???] and [???] seeing that the [???] and the [???] and the [???] 
were [???] [???] his [???] 
 
[???] and his heart was [???] and the heart of his [???] and it 
was made exceeding [???] neither did he let the children of [???] [???] 
as the lord had commanded by the hand of [???] 
 
[???] chapter 10 
 
the [???] plague of the [???] the [???] of [???] [???] is 
still [???] 
 
[???] and the lord said to [???] go in to [???] for i have [???] 
his [???] and the heart of his [???] that i may work these my signs 
in [???] 
 
[???] and thou mayst tell in the ears of thy [???] and of thy [???] 
how often i have [???] the [???] and wrought my signs amongst 
[???] and you may know that i am the [???] 
 
[???] therefore [???] and aaron went in to [???] and said to [???] thus 
[???] the lord god of the [???] how long [???] thou to submit to 
[???] let my people [???] to sacrifice to [???] 
 
[???] but if thou [???] and wilt not let them [???] behold i will bring 
in [???] the [???] into thy [???] 
 
[???] to cover the face of the [???] that nothing thereof may [???] 
but that which the hail hath left may be [???] for they shall feed upon 
all the trees that spring in the [???] 
 
[???] and they shall fill thy [???] and the houses of thy [???] 
and of all the [???] such a number as thy fathers have not [???] 
nor thy [???] from the time they were first upon the [???] 
until this present [???] and he turned himself [???] and went forth from 
 
 
[???] and [???] servants said to [???] how long shall we endure this 
[???] [???] the men go to sacrifice to the lord their [???] dost thou 
not see that egypt is [???] 
 
[???] and they called back [???] and [???] to [???] and he said to 
[???] [???] sacrifice to the lord your [???] who are they that shall [???] 
 
[???] [???] [???] we will go with our young and [???] with our sons and 
[???] with our sheep and [???] for it is the solemnity of the lord 
our [???] 
 
[???] and [???] [???] so be the lord with [???] as i shall let you 
and your children [???] who can doubt but that you intend some great [???] 
 
[???] it shall not be [???] but go ye men [???] and sacrifice to the 
[???] for this yourselves also [???] and immediately they were cast 
out from [???] [???] 
 
[???] and the lord said to [???] stretch forth thy hand upon the land 
of egypt unto the [???] that it come upon [???] and devour every herb 
that is left after the [???] 
 
[???] and [???] [???] forth his rod upon the land of [???] and the 
lord brought a burning wind all that [???] and [???] and when it was 
[???] the burning wind raised the [???] 
 
[???] and they came up over the whole land of [???] and [???] in all 
the [???] of the [???] [???] the like as had not been 
before that [???] nor shall be [???] 
 
[???] and they covered the whole face of the [???] [???] all [???] 
and the grass of the earth was [???] and what [???] [???] were on 
the [???] which the hail had [???] and there remained not any thing 
that was green on the [???] or in the herbs of the [???] in all [???] 
 
[???] wherefore [???] in haste called [???] and [???] and said to 
[???] i have [???] against the lord your [???] and against [???] 
 
[???] but now forgive me my sin this time [???] and pray to the lord 
your [???] that he take away from me this [???] 
 
[???] and [???] going forth from the presence of [???] [???] to the 
 
 
[???] and he made a very strong wind to blow from the [???] and it took 
the [???] and cast them into the red [???] there remained not so much 
as one in all the [???] of [???] 
 
[???] and the lord [???] [???] [???] neither did he let the 
children of [???] [???] 
 
[???] and the lord said to [???] stretch out thy hand towards [???] 
and may there be darkness upon the land of egypt so thick that it may be 
 
 
darkness upon the land of [???] so thick that it may be [???] by 
means of the gross [???] which were to cause and accompany the

horrible darkness in all the land of egypt for three [???] 
 
[???] no man saw his [???] nor moved himself out of the place where

[???] and made of them a [???] [???] and they [???] these are thy [???] 
o [???] that have brought thee out of the land of [???] 
 
[???] and when aaron saw [???] he built an altar before [???] and made 
proclamation by a [???] [???] saying to morrow is the solemnity of

i may destroy [???] and i will make of thee a great [???] 
 
[???] but [???] [???] the lord his [???] [???] [???] o [???] is thy 
indignation [???] against thy [???] whom thou hast brought out of

of [???] and this whole land that i have spoken [???] i will give to 
your [???] and you shall possess it for [???] 
 
[???] and the lord was [???] from doing the evil which he had spoken 
against his [???] 
 
[???] and [???] returned from the [???] carrying the two tables of the 
testimony in his [???] written on both [???]

[???] the noise of battle is heard in the [???] 
 
[???] but he [???] it is not the cry of men [???] to [???] 
nor the shout of men [???] to [???] but i hear the voice of 
 
 
[???] and when he came nigh to the [???] he saw the [???] and the 
[???] and being very [???] he threw the tables out of his [???] and 
broke them at the foot of the [???] 
 
[???] and laying hold of the calf which they had [???] he burnt [???] and 
beat it to [???] which he [???] into [???] and gave thereof to the 
children of [???] to [???] 
 
[???] and he said to [???] what has this people done to [???] that 
thou shouldst bring upon them a most heinous [???] 
 
[???] and he answered [???] let not my lord be [???] for thou 
knowest this [???] that they are [???] to [???] 
 
[???] they said to [???] make us [???] that may go before [???] for as to 
this [???] who brought us forth out of the land of [???] we know not 
what is [???] [???] 
 
[???] and i said to [???] which of you hath any [???] and they took and 
brought it to [???] and i cast it into the [???] and this calf came [???] 
 
[???] and when [???] saw that the people were [???] [???] aaron had 
[???] them by occasion of the shame of the [???] and had set them 
naked among their [???] 
 
[???] having lost not only their [???] and their [???] but what was 
worst of [???] being [???] also of the grace of [???] and having lost 
[???] shame of the [???] that [???] of the [???] which they had 
taken for their [???] it is the usual phrase of the [???] to call 
[???] filth and [???] 
 
[???] then standing in the gate of the [???] he [???] if any man be on 
the [???] [???] let him join with [???] and all the sons of [???] [???] 
themselves together unto [???] 
 
[???] and he said to [???] thus [???] the lord god of [???] put every 
man his sword upon his [???] [???] and return from gate to gate through 
the midst of the [???] and let every man kill his [???] and [???] 
and [???] 
 
[???] and the sons of [???] did according to the words of [???] and 
there were slain that day about three and twenty thousand [???] 
 
[???] and [???] [???] you have [???] your hands this day to the 
[???] every man in his son and in his [???] that a blessing may be 
given to [???] 
 
[???] and when the next day was [???] [???] spoke to the [???] you 
have [???] a very great [???] i will go up to the [???] if by any means 
i may be able to entreat him for your [???] 
 
[???] and returning to the [???] he [???] i beseech [???] this people 
hath [???] a heinous [???] and they have made to themselves gods of 
[???] either forgive them this [???] 
 
[???] or if thou do [???] strike me out of the book that thou hast 
 
 
[???] and the lord answered [???] he that hath [???] against [???] him 
will i strike out of my [???] 
 
[???] but go [???] and lead this people whither i have told [???] my 
angel shall go before [???] and i in the day of revenge will visit this 
sin also of [???] 
 
[???] the lord therefore struck the people for the [???] on occasion 
of the calf which aaron had [???] 
 
[???] chapter [???] 
 
the people mourn for their [???] [???] [???] the [???] without 
the [???] he [???] [???] with [???] [???] to see his [???] 
 
[???] and the lord spoke to [???] [???] [???] get thee up from this 
[???] thou and thy people which thou hast brought out of the land of 
[???] into the land concerning which i swore to [???] [???] and 
[???] [???] to thy seed i will give [???] 
 
[???] and i will send an angel before [???] that i may cast out the 
[???] and the [???] and the [???] and the [???] and 
the [???] and the [???] 
 
[???] that thou mayst enter into the land that [???] with milk and 
[???] for i will not go up with [???] because thou art a [???] 
[???] lest i destroy thee in the [???] 
 
[???] and the people hearing these very bad [???] [???] and no man 
put on his [???] according to [???] 
 
[???] and the lord said to [???] say to the children of [???] thou 
art a [???] [???] once i shall come up in the midst of [???] and 
shall destroy [???] now presently lay aside thy [???] that i may 
know what to do to [???] 
 
[???] so the children of [???] laid aside their [???] by mount 
 
 
[???] [???] also taking the [???] [???] it without the camp afar 
[???] and called the name [???] the [???] of the [???] and 
all the [???] that had any [???] went forth to the [???] of 
the [???] without the [???]

[???] and every one stood in the door of his [???] and they beheld the 
back of [???] till he went into the [???]

they are forbid to fight against the [???] [???] and [???] 
their victory over [???] king of [???] 
 
[???] and [???] from thence we came into the wilderness that [???] 
to the red [???] as the lord had spoken to [???] and we [???] mount 
[???] a long [???] 
 
[???] and the lord said to [???] 
 
[???] you have [???] this mountain long [???] go toward the [???] 
 
[???] and command thou the [???] [???] you shall pass by the [???]

be afraid of [???] 
 
[???] take ye then good heed that you stir not against [???] for i will 
not give you of their land so much as the step of one foot can tread 
[???] because i have given mount [???] to [???] for a [???] 
 
[???] you shall buy [???] of them for money and shall [???] you shall draw 
waters for [???] and shall [???] 
 
[???] the lord thy god hath blessed thee in every work of thy [???] the 
lord thy god dwelling with [???] [???] thy [???] how thou hast 
passed through this great [???] for forty [???] and thou hast 
wanted [???] 
 
[???] and when we had passed by our brethren the children of [???] that 
[???] in [???] by the way of the plain from [???] and from [???] 
we came to the way that [???] to the desert of [???] 
 
[???] and the lord said to [???] fight not against the [???] neither go 
to battle against [???] for i will not give thee any of their [???] 
because i have given ar to the children of lot in [???] 
 
[???] the [???] first were the [???] [???] a people [???] and 
[???] and so [???] that like the race of the [???] 
 
[???] they were [???] as [???] and were like the sons of the 
[???] but the [???] call them [???] 
 
[???] the [???] also [???] [???] in [???] who being driven out 
and [???] the children of [???] [???] [???] as [???] did in the 
land of his [???] which the lord gave [???] 
 
[???] then rising up to pass the [???] [???] we came to [???] 
 
[???] and the time that we [???] from [???] till we passed over 
the [???] [???] was [???] [???] until all the generation of 
the men that were fit for war was [???] out of the [???] as the lord 
had [???] 
 
[???] for his hand was against [???] that they should perish from the 
midst of the [???] 
 
[???] and after all the fighting men were [???] 
 
[???] the lord spoke to [???] [???] 
 
[???] thou shalt pass this day the [???] of [???] the city named [???] 
 
[???] and when thou [???] nigh the [???] of the children of [???] 
take heed thou fight not against [???] nor once move to [???] for i 
will not give thee of the land of the children of [???] because i have 
given it to the children of lot for a [???] 
 
[???] it was [???] a land of [???] and [???] [???] [???] in 
[???] whom the [???] call [???] 
 
[???] a people great and [???] and of tall [???] like the [???] 
whom the lord destroyed before their [???] and he made them to dwell in 
their [???] 
 
[???] as he had done in favour of the children of [???] that dwell in 
[???] [???] the [???] and [???] their land to [???] which 
they possess to this [???] 
 
[???] the [???] [???] that [???] in [???] as far as [???] were 
[???] by the [???] who came out of [???] and destroyed 
them and [???] in their [???] 
 
[???] arise [???] and pass the [???] [???] behold i have delivered into 
thy hand [???] king of [???] the [???] and begin thou to possess 
his land and make war against [???] 
 
[???] this day will i begin to send the dread and fear of thee upon the 
[???] that dwell under the whole [???] that when they hear thy name 
they may fear and [???] and be in pain like women in [???] 
 
[???] so i sent messengers from the wilderness of [???] to [???] the 
king of [???] with [???] [???] [???] 
 
[???] we will pass through thy [???] we will go along by the [???] we 
will not turn aside neither to the right hand nor to the [???] 
 
[???] sell us meat for [???] that we may [???] give us water for money 
and so we will [???] we only ask that thou wilt let us pass [???] 
 
[???] as the children of [???] have [???] that dwell in [???] and the 
[???] that abide in [???] until we come to the [???] and pass to the 
land which the lord our god will give [???] 
 
[???] and [???] the king of [???] would not let us [???] because the 
lord thy god had [???] his [???] and fixed his [???] that he might 
be delivered into thy [???] as now thou [???] 
 
[???] [???] that [???] in punishment of his past sins he left him to 
his own stubborn and [???] [???] which drew him to his [???] 
see the note on [???] [???] 
 
[???] and the lord said to [???] behold i have begun to deliver unto thee 
[???] and his [???] begin to possess [???] 
 
[???] and [???] came out to meet us with all his people to fight at 
 
 
[???] and the lord our god delivered him to [???] and we slew him with his 
sons and all his [???] 
 
[???] and we took all his cities at that [???] killing the [???] 
of [???] men and women and [???] we left nothing of [???] 
 
[???] except the cattle which came to the share of them that took [???] 
and the [???] of the [???] which we [???] 
 
[???] from [???] which is upon the bank of the [???] [???] a town 
that is [???] in a [???] as far as [???] there was not a village 
or [???] that escaped our [???] the lord our god delivered all unto [???] 
 
[???] except the land of the children of [???] to which we [???] 
[???] and all that [???] upon the [???] [???] and the cities in the 
[???] and all the places which the lord our god [???] [???] 
 
[???] chapter 3 
 
the victory over [???] king of [???] [???] [???] and half the tribe of 
[???] receive their possession on the other side of [???] 
 
[???] then we turned and went by the way of [???] and [???] the king of 
[???] came out to meet us with his people to fight in [???] 
 
[???] and the lord said to [???] fear him [???] because he is delivered into 
thy [???] with all his people and his [???] and thou shalt do to him as 
thou hast done to [???] king of the [???] that [???] in [???] 
 
[???] so the lord our god delivered into our [???] [???] [???] the king of 
[???] and all his [???] and we utterly destroyed [???] 
 
[???] [???] all his cities at one [???] there was not a town that 
escaped [???] sixty [???] all the country of [???] the kingdom of [???] in 
 
 
[???] all the cities were [???] with very high [???] and with gates and 
[???] besides [???] towns that had no [???]

[???] [???] every [???] men and women and [???] 
 
[???] but the cattle and the [???] of the cities we took for our [???] 
 
[???] and we took at that time the land out of the hand of the two kings 
of the [???] that were beyond the [???] from the [???] [???] 
unto the mount [???] 
 
[???] which the [???] call [???] and the [???] [???] 
 
[???] all the cities that are [???] in the [???] and all the land of 
[???] and [???] as far as [???] and [???] cities of the kingdom of [???]

bed of iron is [???] which is in [???] of the children of [???] 
being nine [???] [???] and four broad after the measure of the [???] of 
a [???] [???] 
 
[???] and we possessed the land at that time from [???] which is upon 
the bank of the [???] [???] unto the half of mount [???] and i gave 
the cities thereof to [???] and [???] 
 
[???] and i delivered the other part of [???] and all [???] the 
kingdom of [???] to the half tribe of [???] all the country of [???] 
and all [???] is called the land of [???] 
 
[???] [???] the son of [???] possessed all the country of [???] unto 
the [???] of [???] and [???] and he called [???] by his own 
[???] [???] [???] that is to [???] the towns of [???] until this present 
 
 
[???] to [???] also i gave [???] 
 
[???] and to the [???] of [???] and gad i gave of the land of [???] as 
far as the [???] [???] half the [???] and the [???] even unto 
the [???] [???] which is the [???] of the children of [???] 
 
[???] and the plain of the [???] and the [???] and the [???] 
of [???] unto the sea of the [???] which is the most salt [???] to 
the foot of mount [???] [???] 
 
[???] and i commanded you at that [???] [???] the lord your god [???] 
you this land for an [???] go ye well appointed before your 
brethren the children of [???] all the strong men of [???] 
 
[???] leaving your wives and children and [???] for i know you have 
much [???] and they must remain in the [???] which i have delivered 
to [???] 
 
[???] until the lord give rest to your [???] as he hath given to 
[???] and they also possess the [???] which he will give them beyond the 
[???] then shall every man return to his [???] which i have 
given [???] 
 
[???] i commanded [???] also at that [???] [???] thy eyes have seen 
what the lord your god hath done to these two [???] so will he do to 
all the kingdoms to which thou shalt [???] 
 
[???] fear them [???] for the lord your god will fight for [???] 
 
[???] and i [???] the lord at that [???] [???] 
 
[???] lord [???] thou hast begun to [???] unto thy servant thy [???] 
and most mighty [???] for there is no other god either in heaven or 
[???] that is able to do thy [???] or to be [???] to thy [???] 
 
[???] i will pass over [???] and will see this excellent land 
beyond the [???] and this goodly [???] and [???] 
 
[???] and the lord was angry with me on your account and heard me [???] 
but said to [???] it is [???] speak no more to me of this [???] 
 
[???] go up to the top of [???] and cast thy eyes round about to the 
[???] and to the [???] and to the [???] and to the [???] and behold 
[???] for thou shalt not pass this [???] 
 
[???] command [???] and encourage and [???] [???] for he shall go

[???] chapter 4 
 
[???] [???] the people to keep [???] [???] particularly to 
fly [???] [???] three cities of [???] on that side of the 
 
 
[???] and [???] o [???] hear the [???] and [???] which i 
teach [???] that doing [???] thou mayst [???] and [???] in mayst 
possess the land which the lord the god of your fathers will give [???] 
 
[???] you shall not add to the word that i speak to [???] neither shall 
you take away from [???] keep the [???] of the lord your god which 
i command [???] 
 
[???] your eyes have seen all that the lord hath done against [???] 
how he hath destroyed all his [???] from among [???] 
 
[???] but you that [???] to the lord your [???] are all alive until this 
present [???] 
 
[???] you know that i have taught you [???] and [???] as the lord 
my god hath commanded [???] so shall you do them in the land which you 
shall [???] 
 
[???] and you shall [???] and [???] them in [???] for this is 
your [???] and understanding in the sight of [???] that hearing all 
these [???] they may [???] behold a wise and understanding [???] a 
great [???] 
 
[???] neither is there any other nation so [???] that hath gods so nigh 
[???] as our god is present to all our [???] 
 
[???] for what other nation is there so renowned that hath [???] 
and just [???] and all the [???] which i will set forth this day 
before our [???] 
 
[???] keep thyself [???] and thy soul [???] forget not the 
words that thy eyes have [???] and let them not go out of thy heart all 
the days of thy [???] thou shalt teach them to thy sons and to thy 
 
 
[???] from the day in which thou didst stand before the lord thy god in 
[???] when the lord spoke to [???] [???] call together the people unto 
[???] that they may hear my [???] and may learn to fear me all the time 
that they live on the [???] and may teach their [???] 
 
[???] and you came to the foot of the [???] which burned even unto 
[???] and there was [???] and a cloud and [???] in [???] 
 
[???] and the lord spoke to you from the midst of the [???] you heard 
the voice of his [???] but you saw not any form at [???] 
 
[???] and he [???] you his [???] which he commanded you to [???] and 
the ten words that he wrote in two tables of [???] 
 
[???] and he commanded me at that time that i should teach you the 
[???] and [???] which you shall do in the [???] that you shall 
 
 
[???] keep therefore your souls [???] you saw not any [???] in 
the day that the lord god spoke to you in [???] from the midst of the 
 
 
[???] lest perhaps being deceived you might make you a [???] 
[???] or image of male or [???] 
 
[???] the [???] of any [???] that are upon the [???] or of 
[???] that fly under [???] 
 
[???] or of [???] [???] that move on the [???] or of [???] that 
abide in the waters under the [???] 
 
[???] lest perhaps [???] up thy eyes to [???] thou see the sun and 
the [???] and all the stars of [???] and being deceived by error thou 
adore and serve [???] which the lord thy god created for the service of 
all the [???] that are under [???] 
 
[???] but the lord hath taken you and brought you out of the iron 
[???] of [???] to make you his people of [???] as it is this 
present [???] 
 
[???] and the lord was angry with me for your [???] and he swore that i 
should not pass over the [???] nor enter into the excellent [???] 
which he will give [???] 
 
[???] behold i die in this [???] i shall not pass over the [???] you 
shall [???] and possess the goodly [???] 
 
[???] beware lest thou ever forget the [???] of the lord thy [???] 
which he hath made with [???] and make to thyself a [???] likeness of 
those things which the lord hath forbid to be [???] 
 
[???] because the lord thy god is a [???] [???] a jealous [???] 
 
[???] if you shall beget sons and [???] and abide in the [???] and 
being [???] make to yourselves any [???] [???] evil 
before the lord your [???] to provoke him to [???] 
 
[???] i call this day heaven and earth to [???] that you shall 
quickly perish out of the [???] [???] when you have passed over the 
[???] you shall [???] you shall not dwell therein [???] but the 
lord will destroy [???] 
 
[???] and scatter you among all [???] and you shall remain a few 
among the [???] to which the lord shall lead [???] 
 
[???] and there you shall serve [???] that were [???] with [???] [???] 
wood and [???] that neither [???] nor [???] nor [???] nor [???] 
 
[???] and when thou shalt seek there the lord thy [???] thou shalt find 
[???] yet [???] if thou seek him with all thy [???] and all the affliction 
of thy [???] 
 
[???] after all the things [???] shall find [???] in the latter time 
thou shalt return to the lord thy [???] and shalt hear his [???] 
 
[???] because the lord thy god is a merciful [???] he will not leave 
[???] nor altogether destroy [???] nor forget the [???] by which he 
swore to thy [???] 
 
[???] ask of the days of [???] that have been before thy time from the 
day that god created man upon the [???] from one end of heaven to the 
other end [???] if ever there was done the like [???] or it hath 
been known at any [???] 
 
[???] that a people should hear the voice of god speaking out of the 
midst of [???] as thou hast [???] and [???] 
 
[???] if god ever did so as to [???] and take to himself a nation out of 
the midst of [???] by [???] [???] and [???] by [???] and a 
strong [???] and [???] out [???] and horrible [???] according to 
all the things that the lord your god did for you in [???] before thy 
 
 
[???] that thou [???] know that the lord he is [???] and there is no 
other besides [???] 
 
[???] from heaven he made thee to hear his [???] that he might teach 
[???] and upon earth he [???] thee his exceeding great [???] and thou 
didst hear his words out of the midst of the [???] 
 
[???] because he loved thy [???] and chose their seed after [???] and 
he brought thee out of [???] going before thee with his great [???] 
 
[???] to destroy at thy coming very great [???] and stronger than 
thou [???] and to bring thee [???] and give thee their land for a 
[???] as thou seest at this present [???] 
 
[???] know therefore this [???] and think in thy heart that the lord he 
is god in heaven [???] and in the earth [???] and there is no [???] 
 
[???] keep his [???] and [???] which i command [???] that it 
may be well with [???] and thy children after [???] and thou mayst 
remain a long time upon the [???] which the lord thy god will give [???] 
 
[???] then [???] set aside three cities beyond the [???] at the east 
 
 
[???] that any one might [???] to them who should kill his neighbour 
[???] and was not his enemy a day or two [???] and that he 
might escape to some one of these [???] 
 
[???] [???] in the [???] which is [???] in the plains of the 
tribe of [???] and [???] in [???] which is in the tribe of [???] and 
[???] in [???] which is in the tribe of [???] 
 
[???] this is the [???] that [???] set before the children of [???] 
 
[???] and these are the [???] and [???] and [???] which 
he spoke to the children of [???] when they came out of [???] 
 
[???] beyond the [???] in the [???] over against the temple of [???] 
in the land of [???] king of the [???] that [???] in [???] whom 
[???] [???] and the children of [???] coming out of [???] 
 
[???] possessed his [???] and the land of [???] king of [???] of the two 
kings of the [???] who were beyond the [???] towards the rising 
of the [???] 
 
[???] from [???] which is [???] upon the bank of the [???] [???] 
unto mount [???] which is also called [???] 
 
[???] all the plain beyond the [???] at the east [???] unto the sea of 
the [???] and unto the foot of mount [???]

[???] he made not the [???] with our [???] but with [???] who are now 
present and [???] 
 
[???] he spoke to us face to face in the mount out of the midst of [???] 
 
[???] i was the [???] and stood between the lord and you at that [???] 
to [???] you his [???] for you feared the [???] and went not up into the 
[???] and he [???] 
 
[???] i am the lord thy [???] who brought thee out of the land of [???] 
out of the house of [???] 
 
[???] thou shalt not have strange gods in my [???] 
 
[???] thou shalt not make to thy self a [???] [???] nor the likeness of 
any [???] that are in heaven [???] or that are in the earth [???] 
or that abide in the waters under the [???] 
 
[???] thou shalt not adore [???] and thou shalt not serve [???] for i am 
the lord thy [???] a jealous [???] [???] the iniquity of the fathers 
upon their children unto the third and fourth [???] to them that 
hate [???] 
 
[???] and [???] mercy unto many [???] to them that love [???] and 
keep my [???] 
 
[???] thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in [???] for he 
shall not be [???] that [???] his name upon a vain [???] 
 
[???] observe the day of the [???] to [???] [???] as the lord thy 
god hath commanded [???] 
 
[???] six days shalt thou [???] and shalt do all thy [???] 
 
[???] the [???] is the day of the [???] that [???] the rest of the 
lord thy [???] thou shalt not do any work [???] thou nor thy son nor 
thy [???] nor thy [???] nor thy [???] nor thy [???] nor 
thy [???] nor any of thy [???] nor the stranger that is within thy 
[???] that thy [???] and thy [???] may [???] even as

[???] honour thy father and [???] as the lord thy god hath commanded 
[???] that thou mayst live a long [???] and it may be well with thee in 
the [???] which the lord thy god will give [???] 
 
[???] thou shalt not [???]

[???] and when the lord thy god shall have brought thee into the [???] 
for which he swore to thy fathers [???] [???] and [???] and shall 
have given thee great and goodly [???] which thou didst not [???]

of [???] a god mighty and [???] 
 
[???] he will [???] these [???] in thy sight by little and little 
and by [???] thou wilt not be able to destroy them [???] lest 
perhaps the beasts of the earth should increase upon [???] 
 
[???] but the lord thy god shall deliver them in thy [???] and shall 
slay them until they be utterly [???] 
 
[???] and he shall deliver their kings into thy [???] and thou shalt

[???] and neglect his [???] and [???] and [???] which i 
command thee this [???] 
 
[???] lest after thou hast eaten and art [???] hast built goodly

gold and of [???] and of all [???] 
 
[???] thy heart be lifted [???] and thou remember not the lord thy [???] 
who brought thee out of the land of [???] out of the house of [???] 
 
[???] and was thy leader in the great and terrible [???] wherein 
there was the serpent burning with his [???] and the [???] and the 
[???] and no waters at [???] who brought forth streams out of the 
[???] [???] 
 
the [???] a serpent whose bite [???] a violent [???] from whence 
it has its [???] for in greek [???] [???] [???] 
 
[???] and fed thee in the wilderness with [???] which thy fathers knew 
[???] and after he had [???] and proved [???] at the last he had 
mercy on [???] 
 
[???] lest thou shouldst say in thy [???] my own [???] and the 
strength of my own hand have achieved all these things for [???] 
 
[???] but remember the lord thy [???] that he hath given thee [???] 
that he might [???] his [???] concerning which he swore to thy

[???] chapter 9 
 
lest they should [???] their [???] to their own [???] they are 
put in mind of their [???] [???] and other [???] for which they 
should have been [???] but god [???] them for his promise made to 
[???] [???] and [???] 
 
[???] [???] o [???] thou shalt go over the [???] this [???] to possess 
[???] very [???] and stronger than [???] cities [???] and [???] 
up to the [???] 
 
[???] a people great and [???] the sons of the [???] whom thou hast 
[???] and heard [???] against whom no man is able to [???] 
 
[???] thou shalt know therefore this day that the lord thy god himself 
will pass over before [???] a [???] and [???] [???] to destroy 
and [???] and bring them to nothing before thy face [???] as he 
hath spoken to [???] 
 
[???] say not in thy [???] when the lord thy god shall have destroyed 
them in thy [???] for my justice hath the lord brought me in to possess 
this [???] whereas these [???] are destroyed for their [???] 
 
[???] for it is not for thy [???] and the [???] of thy heart 
that thou shalt go in to possess their [???] but because they have done 
[???] they are destroyed at thy coming [???] and that the lord might 
accomplish his [???] which he promised by oath to thy fathers [???] 
[???] and [???] 
 
[???] know therefore that the lord thy god [???] thee not this excellent 
land in possession for thy [???] for thou art a very [???] 
 
 
[???] [???] and forget not how thou [???] the lord thy god to 
wrath in the [???] from the day that thou [???] out of egypt unto 
this [???] thou hast always [???] against the [???] 
 
[???] for in [???] also thou didst provoke [???] and he was [???] and 
would have destroyed [???] 
 
[???] when i went up into the mount to receive the tables of [???] the 
tables of the [???] which the lord made with [???] and i continued in 
the mount forty days and [???] neither eating [???] nor drinking 
 
 
[???] and the lord gave me two tables of stone written with the finger 
of [???] and containing all the words that he spoke to you in the mount 
from the midst of the [???] when the people were assembled [???] 
 
[???] and when forty days were [???] and as many [???] the lord gave 
me the two tables of [???] the tables of the [???] 
 
[???] and said to [???] [???] and go down from hence [???] for thy 
[???] which thou hast brought out of [???] have quickly [???] the 
way that thou hast [???] [???] and have made to themselves a [???] 
 
 
[???] and again the lord said to [???] i see that this people is 
 
 
[???] let me alone that i may destroy [???] and [???] their name from 
under [???] and set thee over a [???] that is greater and stronger 
than [???] 
 
[???] and when i came down from the burning [???] and held the two 
tables of the [???] with both [???] 
 
[???] and saw that you had [???] against the lord your [???] and had 
made to yourselves a [???] [???] and had quickly [???] his [???] 
which he had [???] [???] 
 
[???] i cast the tables out of my [???] and broke them in your [???] 
 
[???] and i fell down before the lord as [???] forty days and nights 
neither eating [???] nor drinking [???] for all your [???] which you 
had committed against the [???] and had [???] him to [???] 
 
[???] for i feared his indignation and [???] wherewith being moved 
against [???] he would have destroyed [???] and the lord heard me this 
time [???] 
 
[???] and he was exceeding angry against aaron [???] and would have 
destroyed [???] and i [???] in like manner for [???] 
 
[???] and your sin that you had [???] that [???] the [???] i [???] 
and burned it with [???] and breaking it into [???] until it was as 
small as [???] i threw it into the [???] which [???] down from the 
 
 
[???] at the burning [???] and at the place of [???] and at the 
graves of lust you [???] the [???] 
 
[???] and when he sent you from [???] [???] go [???] and possess 
the land that i have given [???] and you [???] the commandment of the 
lord your [???] and did not believe [???] neither would you [???] to his 
 
 
[???] but were always rebellious from the day that i began to know [???] 
 
[???] and i lay [???] before the lord forty days and [???] in 
which i humbly [???] [???] that he would not destroy you as he had 
 
 
[???] and [???] i [???] o lord [???] destroy not thy [???] and thy 
[???] which thou hast [???] in thy [???] whom thou hast 
brought out of egypt with a strong [???] 
 
[???] remember thy servants [???] [???] and [???] look not on the 
[???] of this [???] nor on their [???] and [???] 
 
[???] lest perhaps the [???] of the [???] out of which thou hast 
brought [???] [???] the lord could not bring them into the land that he 
promised [???] and he hated [???] therefore he brought them [???] that he 
might kill them in the [???] 
 
[???] who are thy people and thy [???] whom thou hast brought out 
by thy great [???] and in thy [???] out [???] 
 
[???] chapter 10 
 
god [???] the second tables of the [???] a further [???] to fear 
and serve the [???] 
 
[???] at that time the lord said to [???] hew thee two tables of stone 
like the [???] and come up to me into the [???] and thou shalt make 
an [???] of [???] 
 
[???] and i will write on the tables the words that were in [???] which 
thou [???] [???] and thou shalt put them in the [???] 
 
[???] and i made an [???] of [???] [???] and when i had [???] two tables of 
stone like the [???] i went up into the [???] having them in my 
 
 
[???] and he wrote in the [???] according as he had written [???] 
the ten [???] which the lord spoke to you in the mount from the midst 
of the [???] when the people were [???] and he gave them to [???] 
 
[???] and returning from the [???] i came [???] and put the tables into 
the [???] that i had [???] and they are there till this [???] as the 
lord commanded [???] 
 
[???] and the children of [???] removed their camp from [???] of the 
children of [???] into [???] where aaron died and was [???] and 
[???] his son succeeded him in the [???] [???] 
 
[???] by mount [???] for there aaron [???] [???] [???] this and the 
following verses seem to be [???] by way of [???] 
 
[???] from thence they came to [???] from which place they [???] 
and [???] in [???] in a land of waters and [???] 
 
[???] at that time he [???] the tribe of [???] to carry the [???] of 
the [???] of the [???] and to stand before him in the [???] and 
to bless in his name until this present [???] 
 
[???] wherefore [???] hath no part nor possession with his [???] 
because the lord himself is his [???] as the lord thy god promised 
 
 
[???] and i stood in the [???] as [???] forty days and [???] and 
the lord heard me this time [???] and would not destroy [???] 
 
[???] and he said to [???] [???] and walk before the [???] that they may 
[???] and possess the [???] which i swore to their fathers that i would 
give [???] 
 
[???] and [???] [???] what doth the lord thy god require of [???] but 
that thou fear the lord thy [???] and walk in his [???] and love [???] and 
serve the lord thy [???] with all thy [???] and with all thy [???] 
 
[???] and keep the [???] of the [???] and his [???] which 
i command thee this [???] that it may be well with [???] 
 
[???] behold heaven is the [???] thy [???] and the heaven of [???] 
the earth and all things that are [???] 
 
[???] and yet the lord hath been closely joined to thy [???] and 
loved them and chose their seed after [???] that is to [???] [???] out of 
all [???] as this day it is [???] 
 
[???] [???] therefore the [???] of your [???] and [???] your 
neck no [???] 
 
[???] because the lord your god he is the god of [???] and the lord of 
[???] a great god and mighty and [???] who [???] no person nor 
[???] [???] 
 
[???] he doth judgment to the [???] and the [???] [???] the 
[???] and [???] him food and [???] 
 
[???] and do you therefore love [???] because you also were 
strangers in the land of [???] 
 
[???] thou shalt fear the lord thy [???] and serve him [???] to him thou 
shalt [???] and shalt swear by his [???] 
 
[???] he is thy [???] and thy [???] that hath done for thee these 
great and terrible [???] which thy eyes have [???] 
 
[???] in [???] souls thy fathers went down into [???] and behold now 
the lord thy god hath [???] thee as the stars of [???] 
 
[???] chapter 11 
 
the love and service of god are still [???] with a blessing to 
them that serve [???] and threats of punishment if they forsake his [???] 
 
[???] therefore love the lord thy god and observe his [???] and 
[???] his [???] and [???] at all [???] 
 
[???] know this day the things that your children know [???] who saw not 
the [???] of the lord your [???] his great [???] and strong 
[???] and [???] out [???] 
 
[???] the signs and works which he did in the midst of egypt to king 
[???] and to all his [???] 
 
[???] and to all the host of the [???] and to their horses and 
[???] how the waters of the red sea covered [???] when they pursued 
[???] and how the lord destroyed them until this present [???] 
 
[???] and what he hath done to you in the [???] til you came to 
this [???] 
 
[???] and to [???] and [???] the sons of [???] who was the son of 
[???] whom the [???] opening her mouth swallowed up with their 
[???] and [???] and all their [???] which they had in the 
midst of [???] 
 
[???] your eyes have seen all the great works of the [???] that he hath 
 
 
[???] that you may keep all his [???] which i command you this 
[???] and may go [???] and possess the [???] to which you are [???] 
 
[???] and may live in it a long [???] which the lord promised by oath to 
your [???] and to their [???] a land which [???] with milk and 
 
 
[???] for the [???] which thou goest to [???] is not like the land 
of [???] from whence thou [???] [???] [???] when the seed is [???] 
waters are brought in to water it after the manner of [???] 
 
[???] but it is a land of hills and [???] [???] rain from [???] 
 
[???] and the lord thy god doth always visit [???] and his eyes are on it 
from the beginning of the year unto the end [???] 
 
[???] if then you obey my [???] which i command you this [???] 
that you love the lord your [???] and serve him with all your [???] and 
with all your [???] 
 
[???] he will give to your land the early rain and the latter [???] 
that you may gather in your [???] and your [???] and your [???] 
 
[???] and your hay out of the fields to feed your [???] and that you 
may eat and be [???] 
 
[???] beware lest perhaps your heart be [???] and you depart from 
the [???] and serve strange [???] and adore [???] 
 
[???] and the lord being angry shut up [???] that the rain come not 
[???] nor the earth yield her [???] and you perish quickly from the 
excellent [???] which the lord will give [???] 
 
[???] lay up these words in your hearts and [???] and hang them for a 
sign on your [???] and place them between your [???] 
 
[???] teach your children that they [???] on [???] when thou [???] 
in thy [???] and when thou [???] on the [???] and when thou liest down 
and [???] [???] 
 
[???] thou shalt write them upon the posts and the doors of thy [???] 
 
[???] that thy days may be [???] and the days of thy children in 
the land which the lord swore to thy [???] that he would give them as 
long as the heaven [???] over the [???] 
 
[???] for if you keep the [???] which i command [???] and do 
[???] to love the lord your [???] and walk in all his [???] [???] unto 
 
 
[???] the lord will destroy all these [???] before your [???] and you 
shall possess [???] which are greater and stronger than [???] 
 
[???] every [???] that your foot shall tread [???] shall be [???] 
from the [???] and from [???] from the great river [???] unto 
the western sea shall be your [???] 
 
[???] none shall stand against [???] the lord your god shall lay the 
dread and fear of you upon all the land that you shall tread [???] as he 
hath spoken to [???] 
 
[???] behold i set forth in your sight this day a blessing and a [???] 
 
[???] a [???] if you obey the [???] of the lord your [???] 
which i command you this [???]

but revolt from the way which now i [???] [???] and walk after strange 
gods which you know [???]
