this e-text comes from [???] [???] of [???]'s [???] [???]-
[???] [???] of the holy [???]. In 1568 english [???] [???] many from 
oxford [???] established the english [???] of [???] ([???] [???] [???]) [???] [???] [???] 
under william (later cardinal) [???]. In [???] [???] 1578 [???] gregory martin 
began the work of [???] an english [???] of the [???] for 
[???] [???] [???] the first such [???] into [???] english.
[???] were william [???] [???] richard [???] [???] thomas [???] [???] and 
william [???] who [???] [???] [???] [???] and [???] dr. Martin's 
work. The [???] [???] the new [???] at [???] ([???] [???] [???]) [???] 
france [???] in 1582 through john [???] with a [???] and [???] notes [???] 
[???] chiefly by [???] [???] [???] [???] and [???]. Later the old 
[???] was [???] at [???] in two parts (1609 and 1610) by [???] 
[???] through the [???] of dr. [???] [???] then [???] of the 
[???]. The [???] had been prepared before the appearance of the 
new [???] [???] but the [???] was [???] due to [???] 
[???]. The religious and [???] [???] to the [???] [???] 
text led to the less [???] and [???] words and [???] often found 
in the [???]. In some [???] where no english word [???] the 
full meaning of the [???] [???] a [???] word was [???] and its meaning 
[???] in a [???]. Although [???] by [???] [???] many of these 
words later found common usage in the english language. [???] of 
proper names and the [???] of the [???] are adopted from the [???] 
[???].
 
in 1749 dr. Richard [???] began a [???] [???] of the [???] and 
[???] [???] [???] the [???] and [???] of which had become [???] 
[???] in the almost two [???] since the [???] were first 
produced. He [???] the diction and [???] a more [???] style [???] 
while faithfully [???] the [???] of dr. Martin's [???]. This 
[???] became the'de [???]'[???] text for english speaking 
[???] until the twentieth century. It is still highly regarded by 
many for its style [???] although it is now rarely used for [???] 
purposes. The notes [???] in this [???] [???] are generally 
[???] to bishop [???].

the book of [???] 
 
this book is so called from its [???] of the generation [???] that is [???] 
of the [???] and the beginning of the world. The [???] call it 
[???] [???] from the word with which it begins. It contains not only 
the history of the [???] of the world; but also an account of its 
progress during the space of 2369 years [???] that is [???] until the death of 
joseph.
 
 
[???] chapter 1
 
god [???] heaven and earth [???] and all things therein [???] in six days.
 
1:1. In the beginning god created heaven [???] and earth.
 
1:2. And the earth was [???] and empty [???] and darkness was upon the face of 
the deep; and the spirit of god moved over the waters.
 
1:3. And god said: be light made. And light was made.
 
1:4. And god saw the light that it was good; and he divided the light 
from the darkness.
 
1:5. And he called the light day [???] and the darkness night; and there was 
evening and morning one day.
 
1:6. And god said: let there be a [???] made [???] the waters: and 
let it divide the waters from the waters.
 
a [???]... By this name is here understood the whole space between 
the earth [???] and the highest stars. The lower part of which [???] the 
waters that are upon the earth [???] from those that are above in the clouds.
 
1:7. And god made a [???] [???] and divided the waters that were under 
the [???] [???] from those that were above the [???] [???] and it was so.
 
1:8. And god called the [???] [???] heaven; and the evening and morning 
were the second day.
 
1:9. God also said; let the waters that are under the heaven [???] be 
[???] together into one place: and let the dry land appear. And it 
was so done.
 
1:10. And god called the dry land [???] earth; and the [???] together of 
the waters [???] he called seas. And god saw that it was good.
 
1:11. And he said: let the earth bring forth green herb [???] and such as may 
seed [???] and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind [???] which may have 
seed in itself upon the earth. And it was so done.
 
1:12. And the earth brought forth the green herb [???] and such as [???] 
seed according to its kind [???] and the tree that [???] fruit [???] having seed 
each one according to its kind. And god saw that it was good.
 
1:13. And the evening and the morning were the third day.
 
1:14. And god said: let there be lights made in the [???] of heaven [???] 
to divide the day and the night [???] and let them be for signs [???] and for 
seasons [???] and for days and years:
 
1:15. To shine in the [???] of heaven [???] and to give light upon the 
earth [???] and it was so done.
 
1:16. And god made two great lights: a greater light to rule the day;
and a lesser light to rule the night: and the stars.
 
two great lights... God created on the first day [???] light [???] which being 
moved from east to west [???] by its rising and setting [???] made morning and 
evening. But on the fourth day he ordered and [???] this light [???] 
and made the sun [???] moon [???] and stars. The moon [???] though much less than the 
stars [???] is here called a great light [???] from its giving a far greater light 
to the earth than any of them.
 
1:17. And he set them in the [???] of heaven to shine upon the 
earth.
 
1:18. And to rule the day and the night [???] and to divide the light and the 
darkness. And god saw that it was good.
 
1:19. And the evening and morning were the fourth day.
 
1:20. God also said: let the waters bring forth the [???] creature 
having life [???] and the fowl that may fly over the earth under the 
[???] of heaven.
 
1:21. And god created the great [???] [???] and every living and moving 
creature [???] which the waters brought forth [???] according to their kinds [???] and 
every winged fowl according to its kind. And god saw that it was good.
 
1:22. And he blessed them [???] saying: increase and [???] [???] and fill the 
waters of the sea: and let the birds be [???] upon the earth.
 
1:23. And the evening and morning were the fifth day.
 
1:24. And god said: let the earth bring forth the living creature in its 
kind [???] cattle and [???] things [???] and beasts of the earth [???] according to 
their kinds. And it was so done.
 
1:25. And god made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds [???] and 
cattle [???] and every thing that [???] on the earth after its kind. And 
god saw that it was good.
 
1:26. And he said: let us make man to our image and likeness: and let 
him have [???] over the [???] of the sea [???] and the [???] of the air [???] 
and the beasts [???] and the whole earth [???] and every [???] creature that 
[???] upon the earth.
 
let us make man to our image... This image of god in man [???] is not in the 
body [???] but in the soul; which is a [???] substance [???] [???] with 
understanding and free will. God [???] here in the [???] number [???] to 
[???] the [???] of persons in the [???].
 
1:27. And god created man to his own image: to the image of god he 
created him: male and female he created them.
 
1:28. And god blessed them [???] saying: increase and [???] [???] and fill the 
earth [???] and [???] it [???] and rule over the [???] of the sea [???] and the [???] 
of the air [???] and all living creatures that move upon the earth.
 
increase and [???]... This is not a [???] [???] as some [???] 
[???] would have it [???] but a blessing [???] [???] them fruitful;
for god had said the same words to the [???] [???] and birds [???] (ver. 22) who 
were incapable of receiving a [???].
 
1:29. And god said: behold i have given you every herb bearing seed upon 
the earth [???] and all trees that have in themselves seed of their own kind [???] 
to be your meat:
 
1:30. And to all beasts of the earth [???] and to every fowl of the air [???] and 
to all that move upon the earth [???] and wherein there is life [???] that they 
may have to feed upon. And it was so done.
 
1:31. And god saw all the things that he had made [???] and they were very 
good. And the evening and morning were the sixth day.
 
[???] chapter 2
 
god [???] on the [???] day and [???] it. The earthly paradise [???] in 
which god [???] man. He [???] him not to eat of the tree of 
knowledge. And [???] a woman of his rib.
 
2:1. So the heavens and the earth were finished [???] and all the furniture 
of them.
 
2:2. And on the [???] day god ended his work which he had made: and he 
[???] on the [???] day from all his work which he had done.
 
he [???] [???] etc... That is [???] he ceased to make or create any new kinds of 
things. Though [???] as our lord tells us [???] john 5. 17 [???] [???] he still [???] [???] [???] 
viz. [???] by [???] and [???] all things [???] and [???] souls.
 
2:3. And he blessed the [???] day [???] and [???] it: because in it he 
had [???] from all his work which god created and made.
 
2:4. These are the [???] of the heaven and the earth [???] when they 
were created [???] in the day that the lord god made the heaven and the 
earth:
 
2:5. And every plant of the field before it sprung up in the earth [???] and 
every herb of the ground before it grew: for the lord god had not [???] 
upon the earth; and there was not a man to till the earth.
 
2:6. But a spring rose out of the earth [???] [???] all the surface of the 
earth.
 
2:7. And the lord god formed man of the [???] of the earth: and breathed 
into his face the breath of life [???] and man became a living soul.
 
2:8. And the lord god had planted a paradise of pleasure from the 
beginning: wherein he placed man whom he had formed.
 
2:9. And the lord god brought forth of the ground all manner of trees [???] 
fair to behold [???] and pleasant to eat of: the tree of life also in the 
midst of paradise: and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
 
the tree of life... So called because it had that quality [???] that by 
eating of the fruit of it [???] man would have been [???] in a constant 
state of health [???] vigour [???] and strength [???] and would not have died at all.
the tree of knowledge... To which the [???] serpent falsely 
[???] the power of [???] a [???] kind of knowledge [???] beyond 
that which god was pleased to give.
 
2:10. And a river went out of the place of pleasure to water paradise [???] 
which from thence is divided into four heads.
 
2:11. The name of the one is [???]: that is it which [???] all the 
land of [???] [???] where gold [???].
 
2:12. And the gold of that land is very good: there is found [???] [???] 
and the [???] stone.
 
2:13. And the name of the second river is [???]: the same is it that 
[???] all the land of [???].
 
2:14. And the name of the third river is [???]: the same [???] along 
by the [???]. And the fourth river is [???].
 
2:15. And the lord god took man [???] and put him into the paradise of 
pleasure [???] to dress it [???] and to keep it.
 
2:16. And he commanded him [???] saying: of every tree of paradise thou shalt 
eat:
 
2:17. But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil [???] thou shalt not eat.
for in what day [???] thou shalt eat of it [???] thou shalt die the death.
 
2:18. And the lord god said: it is not good for man to be alone: let us 
make him a help like unto himself.
 
2:19. And the lord god having formed out of the ground all the beasts of 
the earth [???] and all the [???] of the air [???] brought them to adam to see 
what he would call them: for whatsoever adam called any living creature 
the same is its name.
 
2:20. And adam called all the beasts by their names [???] and all the [???] 
of the air [???] and all the cattle of the field: but for adam there was not 
found a [???] like himself.
 
2:21. Then the lord god cast a deep sleep upon adam: and when he was 
fast asleep [???] he took one of his ribs [???] and filled up flesh for it.
 
2:22. And the lord god built the rib which he took from adam into a 
woman: and brought her to adam.
 
2:23. And adam said: this now is bone of my bones [???] and flesh of my 
flesh; she shall be called woman [???] because she was taken out of man.
 
2:24. Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother [???] and shall [???] to 
his wife: and they shall be two in one flesh.
 
2:25. And they were both naked: to wit [???] adam and his wife: and were not 
ashamed.
 
[???] chapter 3
 
the serpent's craft. The fall of our first parents. Their punishment.
the promise of a [???].
 
3:1. Now the serpent was more subtle than any of the beasts of the earth 
which the lord god had made. And he said to the woman: why hath god 
commanded you [???] that you should not eat of every tree of paradise?
 
3:2. And the woman answered him [???] saying: of the fruit of the trees that 
are in paradise we do eat:
 
3:3. But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of paradise [???] god 
hath commanded us that we should not eat; and that we should not touch 
it [???] lest perhaps we die.
 
3:4. And the serpent said to the woman: no [???] you shall not die the death.
 
3:5. For god doth know that in what day [???] you shall eat thereof [???] 
your eyes shall be opened: and you shall be as gods [???] knowing good and 
evil.
 
3:6. And the woman saw that the tree was good to eat [???] and fair to the 
eyes [???] and [???] to behold: and she took of the fruit thereof [???] and 
did eat [???] and gave to her husband [???] who did eat.
 
3:7. And the eyes of them both were opened: and when they perceived 
themselves to be naked [???] they [???] together fig leaves [???] and made 
themselves [???].
 
and the eyes [???] etc... Not that they were blind before [???] (for the woman saw 
that the tree was fair to the eyes [???] ver. 6.) nor yet that their eyes 
were opened to any more perfect knowledge of good; but only to the 
unhappy experience of having lost the good of original grace and 
innocence [???] and [???] the dreadful evil of sin. From whence followed a 
shame of their being naked; which they minded not before; because being 
now [???] of original grace [???] they quickly began to be subject to the 
shameful [???] of the flesh.
 
3:8. And when they heard the voice of the lord god walking in paradise 
at the afternoon air [???] adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of 
the lord god [???] [???] the trees of paradise.
 
3:9. And the lord god called adam [???] and said to him: where art thou?
 
3:10. And he said: i heard thy voice in paradise; and i was afraid [???] 
because i was naked [???] and i hid myself.
 
3:11. And he said to him: and who hath told thee that thou wast naked [???] 
but that thou hast eaten of the tree whereof i commanded thee that thou 
shouldst not eat?
 
3:12. And adam said: the woman [???] whom thou [???] me to be my companion [???] 
gave me of the tree [???] and i did eat.
 
3:13. And the lord god said to the woman: why hast thou done this? and 
she answered: the serpent deceived me [???] and i did eat.
 
3:14. And the lord god said to the serpent: because thou hast done this 
thing [???] thou art cursed among all cattle [???] and beasts of the earth: upon 
thy breast shalt thou go [???] and earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy 
life.
 
3:15. I will put [???] between thee and the woman [???] and thy seed and 
her seed: she shall crush thy head [???] and thou shalt lie in wait for her 
heel.
 
she shall crush... [???] [???] the woman; so divers of the fathers read this 
place [???] [???] to the [???]: others read it [???] [???] viz. [???] the seed.
the sense is the same: for it is by her seed [???] [???] christ [???] that the 
woman [???] the serpent's head.
 
3:16. To the woman also he said: i will [???] thy sorrows [???] and thy 
[???]: in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children [???] and thou shalt 
be under thy husband's power [???] and he shall have [???] over thee.
 
3:17. And to adam he said: because thou hast [???] to the voice of 
thy wife [???] and hast eaten of the tree [???] whereof i commanded thee [???] that 
thou shouldst not eat [???] cursed is the earth in thy work: with labour and 
toil shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy life.
 
3:18. Thorns and [???] shall it bring forth to thee [???] and thou shalt 
eat the herbs of the earth.
 
3:19. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to 
the earth out of which thou wast taken: for dust thou art [???] and into dust 
thou shalt return.
 
3:20. And adam called the name of his wife eve: because she was the 
mother of all the living.
 
3:21. And the lord god made for adam and his wife garments of [???] [???] and 
[???] them.
 
3:22. And he said: behold adam is become as one of us [???] knowing good and 
evil: now therefore lest perhaps he put forth his hand and take also of 
the tree of life [???] and eat [???] and live for ever.
 
behold adam [???] etc... This was spoken by way of [???] him with his 
pride [???] in [???] a knowledge that might make him like to god.
 
3:23. And the lord god sent him out of the paradise of pleasure [???] to till 
the earth from which he was taken.
 
3:24. And he cast out adam: and placed before the paradise of pleasure 
[???] [???] and a [???] sword [???] turning every way [???] to keep the way of 
the tree of life.
 
[???] chapter 4
 
the history of [???] and [???].
 
4:1. And adam knew eve his wife; who [???] and brought forth [???] [???] 
saying: i have [???] a man through god.
 
4:2. And again she brought forth his brother [???]. And [???] was a 
shepherd [???] and [???] a [???].
 
4:3. And it came to pass after many days [???] that [???] offered [???] of the 
[???] of the earth [???] gifts to the lord.
 
4:4. [???] also offered of the [???] of his flock [???] and of their fat:
and the lord had respect to [???] [???] and to his [???].
 
had respect... That is [???] [???] his acceptance of his sacrifice (as 
coming from a heart full of devotion): and that [???] as we may suppose [???] by 
some [???] token [???] such as sending fire from heaven upon his [???].
 
4:5. But to [???] and his [???] he had no respect: and [???] was 
exceeding angry [???] and his countenance fell.
 
4:6. And the lord said to him: why art thou angry? and why is thy 
countenance fallen?
 
4:7. If thou do well [???] shalt thou not receive? but if ill [???] shall not sin 
forthwith be present at the door? but the lust thereof shall be under 
thee [???] and thou shalt have [???] over it.
 
4:8. And [???] said to [???] his brother: let us go forth abroad. And when 
they were in the field [???] [???] rose up against his brother [???] [???] and slew 
him.
 
4:9. And the lord said to [???]: where is thy brother [???]? and he 
answered: i know not: am i my brother's keeper?
 
4:10. And he said to him: what hast thou done? the voice of thy 
brother's blood [???] to me from the earth.
 
4:11. Now therefore cursed shalt thou be upon the earth [???] which hath 
opened her mouth and received the blood of thy brother at thy hand.
 
4:12. When thou shalt till it [???] it shall not yield to thee its fruit: a 
[???] and a [???] shalt thou be upon the earth.
 
4:13. And [???] said to the lord: my iniquity is greater than that i may 
deserve pardon.
 
4:14. Behold thou dost cast me out this day from the face of the earth [???] 
and from thy face i shall be hid [???] and i shall be a [???] and a 
[???] on the earth: every one therefore that [???] me [???] shall kill 
me.
 
every one that [???] me shall kill me... His guilty conscience made 
him fear his own brothers and [???]; of whom [???] by this time [???] there might 
be a good number upon the earth; which had now endured near 130 years;
as may be [???] from gen. 5. 3[???] [???] with chap. 4. 25 [???] though in 
the [???] account given in the [???] [???] only [???] and [???] are 
mentioned.
 
4:15. And the lord said to him: no [???] it shall not so be: but [???] 
shall kill [???] [???] shall be [???] [???]. And the lord set a mark 
upon [???] [???] that [???] found him should not kill him.
 
set a mark [???] etc... The more common opinion of the [???] of holy 
writ [???] this mark to have been a trembling of the body; or a 
horror and [???] in his countenance.

i have slain a man [???] etc... It is the [???] of the [???] [???] that

worship and [???] of god.

[???] chapter 6
 
man's sin is the cause of the [???]. [???] is commanded to build the [???].
 
6:1. And after that men began to be [???] upon the earth [???] and 
daughters were born to them [???] 
 
6:2. The sons of god seeing the daughters of men [???] that they were fair [???] 
took to themselves wives of all which they chose.
 
the sons of god... The [???] of [???] and [???] are here called sons 
of god from their religion and [???]: whereas the [???] race of [???] [???] 
who by their [???] affections lay [???] upon the earth [???] are called 
the children of men. The unhappy consequence of the former [???] with 
the latter [???] ought to be a warning to [???] to be very [???] 
in their [???]; and not to suffer themselves to be determined in 
their choice by their [???] passion [???] to the [???] of virtue or 
religion.
 
6:3. And god said: my spirit shall not remain in man for ever [???] because 
he is flesh [???] and his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.
 
his days shall be [???] etc... The meaning is [???] that man's days [???] which before 
the flood were usually 900 years [???] should now be [???] to 120 years. Or 
rather [???] that god would allow men this term of 120 years [???] for their 
[???] and [???] [???] before he would send the [???].
 
6:4. Now [???] were upon the earth in those days. For after the sons of 
god went in to the daughters of men [???] and they brought forth children [???] 
these are the mighty men of old [???] men of renown.
 
[???]... It is likely the [???] of men before the flood were of a 
[???] [???] in comparison with what men now are. But these here 
spoken of are called [???] [???] as being not only tall in [???] [???] but 
violent and savage in their [???] [???] and mere monsters of cruelty 
and lust.
 
6:5. And god seeing that the [???] of men was great on the earth [???] 
and that all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil at all times [???] 
 
6:6. It [???] him that he had made man on the earth. And being 
touched [???] with sorrow of heart [???] 
 
it [???] him [???] etc... God [???] who is [???] [???] is not capable of 
[???] [???] grief [???] or any other passion. But these [???] are used 
to [???] the [???] of the sins of men [???] which was so [???] as to 
determine their [???] to destroy these his creatures [???] whom before he 
had so much favoured.
 
6:7. He said: i will destroy man [???] whom i have created [???] from the face of 
the earth [???] from man even to beasts [???] from the [???] thing even to the 
[???] of the air [???] for it [???] me that i have made them.
 
6:8. But [???] found grace before the lord.
 
6:9. These are the [???] of [???]: [???] was a just and perfect man in 
his [???] [???] he walked with god.
 
6:10. And he begot three sons [???] [???] [???] cham [???] and [???].
 
6:11. And the earth was corrupted before god [???] and was filled with 
iniquity.
 
6:12. And when god had seen that the earth was corrupted (for all flesh 
had corrupted its way upon the earth) [???] 
 
6:13. He said to [???]: the end of all flesh is come before me [???] the earth 
is filled with iniquity through them [???] and i will destroy them with the 
earth.
 
6:14. Make thee an [???] of [???] [???]: thou shalt make little rooms in 
the [???] [???] and thou shalt pitch it within and without.
 
6:15. And thus shalt thou make it. The length of the [???] shall be three 
hundred [???]: the [???] of it fifty [???] [???] and the height of it 
thirty [???].
 
three hundred [???] [???] etc... The [???] [???] according to the [???] here 
set down [???] contained four hundred and fifty thousand square [???]; which 
was more than enough to contain all the kinds of living creatures [???] with 
all necessary [???]: even supposing the [???] here spoken of to 
have been only a foot and a half each [???] which was the least king of 
[???].
 
6:16. Thou shalt make a window in the [???] [???] and in a [???] shalt thou 
finish the top of it: and the door of the [???] thou shalt set in the 
side: with lower [???] middle chambers [???] and third [???] shalt thou make it.
 
6:17. Behold [???] i will bring the waters of a great flood upon the earth [???] 
to destroy all flesh [???] wherein is the breath of life under heaven. All 
things that are in the earth shall be [???].
 
6:18. And i will establish my [???] with thee [???] and thou shalt enter 
into the [???] [???] thou and thy sons [???] and thy wife [???] and the wives of thy sons 
with thee.
 
6:19. And of every living creature of all flesh [???] thou shalt bring two of 
a sort into the [???] [???] that they may live with thee: of the male sex [???] and 
the female.
 
6:20. Of [???] according to their kind [???] and of beasts in their kind [???] and 
of every thing that [???] on the earth according to its kind: two of 
every sort shall go in with thee [???] that they may live.
 
6:21. Thou shalt take unto thee of all food that may be eaten [???] and thou 
shalt lay it up with thee: and it shall be food for thee and them.
 
6:22. And [???] did all things which god commanded him.
 
[???] chapter 7
 
[???] with his family go into the [???]. The [???] [???] the earth.
 
7:1. And the lord said to him: go in [???] thou and all thy house [???] into the 
[???]: for thee i have seen just before me in this generation.
 
7:2. Of all clean beasts take seven and seven [???] the male and the female.
 
of all clean... The [???] of clean and unclean beasts appears to 
have been made before the law of [???] [???] which was not [???] till 
the year of the world 2514.
 
7:3. But of the beasts that are unclean two and two [???] the male and the 
female. Of the [???] also of the air seven and seven [???] the male and the 
female: that seed may be saved upon the face of the whole earth.
 
7:4. For yet a while [???] and after seven days [???] i will rain upon the earth 
forty days and forty nights: and i will destroy every substance that i 
have made [???] from the face of the earth.
 
7:5. And [???] did all things which the lord had commanded him.
 
7:6. And he was six hundred years old [???] when the waters of the flood

7:7. And [???] went in and his sons [???] his wife and the wives of his sons 
with him into the [???] [???] because of the waters of the flood.
 
7:8. And of beasts clean and unclean [???] and of [???] [???] and of every thing 
that [???] upon the earth [???] 
 
7:9. Two and two went in to [???] into the [???] [???] male and female [???] as the 
lord had commanded [???].
 
7:10. And after the seven days were passed [???] the waters of the flood 
[???] the earth.
 
7:11. In the six [???] year of the life of [???] [???] in the second month [???] 
in the [???] day of the month [???] all the [???] of the great deep 
were broken up [???] and the [???] of heaven were opened:
 
7:12. And the rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
 
7:13. In the [???] day [???] [???] and [???] [???] and cham [???] and [???] [???] his sons:
his wife [???] and the three wives of his sons with them [???] went into the [???].
 
7:14. They and every beast according to its kind [???] and all the cattle in 
their kind [???] and every thing that [???] upon the earth [???] according to its 
kind [???] and every fowl according to its kind [???] all birds [???] and all that fly [???] 
 
7:15. Went in to [???] into the [???] [???] two and two of all flesh [???] wherein was 
the breath of life.
 
7:16. And they that went in [???] went in male and female of all flesh [???] as 
god had commanded him: and the lord shut him in on the outside.
 
7:17. And the flood was forty days upon the earth: and the waters 
[???] [???] and lifted up the [???] on high from the earth.
 
7:18. For they [???] exceedingly: and filled all on the face of the 
earth: and the [???] was carried upon the waters.

the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered.

covered.
 
7:21. And all flesh was destroyed that moved upon the earth [???] both of

god's [???] to him.
 
8:1. And god remembered [???] [???] and all the living creatures [???] and all the 
cattle which were with him in the [???] [???] and brought a wind upon the 
earth [???] and the waters were [???]:
 
8:2. The [???] also of the deep [???] and the [???] of heaven [???] were 
shut up [???] and the rain from heaven was [???].
 
8:3. And the waters returned from off the earth going and coming: and 
they began to be [???] after a hundred and fifty days.
 
8:4. And the [???] [???] in the [???] month [???] the seven and twentieth 
day of the month [???] upon the mountains of [???].
 
8:5. And the waters were going and [???] until the [???] month: for 
in the [???] month [???] the first day of the month [???] the tops of the 
mountains appeared.
 
8:6. And after that forty days were passed [???] [???] opening the window of 
the [???] [???] which he had made [???] sent forth a raven:
 
8:7. Which went forth and did not return [???] till the waters were dried up 
upon the earth.
 
did not return... The raven did not return into the [???]; but (as it may 
be [???] from the [???]) went to and fro; sometimes going to the 
mountains [???] where it found [???] to feed on: and other times 
returning [???] to rest upon the top of the [???].
 
8:8. He sent forth also a dove after him [???] to see if the waters had now 
ceased upon the face of the earth.
 
8:9. But she not finding where her foot might rest [???] returned to him into 
the [???]: for the waters were upon the whole earth: and he put forth his 
hand [???] and caught her [???] and brought her into the [???].
 
8:10. And having waited yet seven other days [???] he again sent forth the 
dove out of the [???].
 
8:11. And she came to him in the evening carrying a bough of an [???] 
tree [???] with green leaves [???] in her mouth. [???] therefore understood that the 
waters were ceased upon the earth.
 
8:12. And he [???] yet other seven days: and he sent forth the dove [???] 
which returned not any more unto him.
 
8:13. Therefore in the six [???] and first year [???] the first month [???] 
the first day of the month [???] the waters were [???] upon the earth [???] and 
[???] opening the covering of the [???] [???] looked [???] and saw that the face of

8:16. Go out of the [???] [???] thou and thy wife [???] thy sons and the wives of 
thy sons with thee.
 
8:17. All living things that are with thee of all flesh [???] as well in 
[???] as in beasts [???] and all [???] things that creep upon the earth [???] 
bring out with thee [???] and go ye upon the earth: increase and [???] 
upon it.
 
8:18. So [???] went out [???] he and his sons: his wife [???] and the wives of his

[???] that were clean [???] offered [???] upon the altar.
 
[???] [???]... Or whole burnt [???]. In which the whole [???] was 
[???] by fire upon god's altar [???] and no part was reserved for the use 
of priest or people.
 
8:21. And the lord [???] a sweet savour [???] and said: i will no more 
curse the earth for the sake of man: for the imagination and thought of 
man's heart are [???] to evil from his youth: therefore i will no more 
destroy every living soul as i have done.
 
[???] [???] etc... A [???] expression [???] [???] that god was well 
pleased with the [???] which his servant offered.
 
8:22. All the days of the earth [???] [???] and harvest [???] cold and heat [???] 
summer and winter [???] night and day [???] shall not cease.
 
[???] chapter 9
 
god [???] [???]: [???] blood [???] and [???] never more to destroy 
the world by water. The blessing of [???] and [???].
 
9:1. And god blessed [???] and his sons. And he said to them: increase [???] 
and [???] [???] and fill the earth.
 
9:2. And let the fear and dread of you be upon all the beasts of the 
earth [???] and upon all the [???] of the air [???] and all that move upon the 
earth: all the [???] of the sea are delivered into your hand.
 
9:3. And every thing that [???] [???] and [???] shall be meat for you: even 
as the green herbs have i delivered them all to you:
 
9:4. Saving that flesh with blood you shall not eat.
 
9:5. For i will require the blood of your lives at the hand of every 
beast [???] and at the hand of man [???] at the hand of every man [???] and of his 
brother [???] will i require the life of man.
 
9:6. [???] shall shed man's blood [???] his blood shall be shed: for man 
was made to the image of god.
 
9:7. But increase you and [???] [???] and go upon the earth and fill it.
 
9:8. Thus also said god to [???] [???] and to his sons with him:
 
9:9. Behold i will establish my [???] with you [???] and with your seed 
after you:
 
9:10. And with every living soul that is with you [???] as well in all birds [???] 
as in cattle and beasts of the earth [???] that are come forth out of the 
[???] [???] and in all the beasts of the earth.
 
9:11. I will establish my [???] with you [???] and all flesh shall be no 
more destroyed with the waters of a flood [???] neither shall there be from 
henceforth a flood to waste the earth.
 
9:12. And god said: this is the sign of the [???] which i give 
between me and you [???] and to every living soul that is with you [???] for 
perpetual [???].
 
9:13. I will set my bow in the clouds [???] and it shall be the sign of a 
[???] between me and between the earth.
 
9:14. And when i shall cover the sky with clouds [???] my bow shall appear in 
the clouds:
 
9:15. And i will remember my [???] with you [???] and with every living 
soul that [???] flesh: and there shall no more be waters of a flood to 
destroy all flesh.
 
9:16. And the bow shall be in the clouds [???] and i shall see it [???] and shall 
remember the everlasting [???] [???] that was made between god and every 
living soul of all flesh which is upon the earth.
 
9:17. And god said to [???]: this shall be the sign of the [???] [???] which 
i have established [???] between me and all flesh upon the earth.
 
9:18. And the sons of [???] [???] who came out of the [???] [???] were [???] [???] cham [???] and 
[???]: and cham is the father of [???].
 
9:19. These three are the sons of [???]: and from these was all mankind 
spread over the whole earth.
 
9:20. And [???] a [???] began to till the ground [???] and planted a 
[???].
 
9:21. And drinking of the wine was made drunk [???] and was [???] in his 
tent.
 
drunk... [???] by the judgment of the fathers was not guilty of sin [???] in 
being overcome by wine: because he knew not the strength of it.
 
9:22. Which when cham the father of [???] had seen [???] to wit [???] that his 
father's [???] was [???] [???] he told it to his two brethren 
without.
 
9:23. But [???] and [???] put a cloak upon their shoulders [???] and going 
backward [???] covered the [???] of their father: and their faces were 
turned away [???] and they saw not their father's [???].
 
covered the [???]... Thus [???] as st. Gregory takes notice L. 35; moral.
C. 22 [???] we ought to cover the [???] [???] that is [???] the sins [???] of our 
[???] parents and [???].
 
9:24. And [???] [???] from the wine [???] when he had learned what his 
younger son had done to him [???] 
 
9:25. He said: cursed be [???] [???] a servant of servants shall he be unto 
his brethren.
 
cursed be [???]... The curses [???] as well as the blessings [???] of the 
[???] [???] were [???]: and this in particular is here [???] by 
[???] [???] for the children of [???] [???] who were to possess the land of 
[???]. But why should [???] be cursed for his father's faults? the 
[???] answer [???] that he being then a boy [???] was the first that saw his 
grandfather's [???] [???] and told his father cham of it; and joined with 
him in laughing at it: which drew upon him [???] rather than upon the rest of 
the children of cham [???] this [???] curse.
 
9:26. And he said: blessed be the lord god of [???] [???] be [???] his 
servant.
 
9:27. May god enlarge [???] [???] and may he dwell in the tents of [???] [???] and 
[???] be his servant.
 
9:28. And [???] lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
 
9:29. And all his days were in the whole nine hundred and fifty years:
and he died.

11:2. And when they removed from the east [???] they found a plain in the 
land of [???] [???] and [???] in it.
 
11:3. And each one said to his neighbour: come let us make [???] [???] and 
[???] them with fire. And they had [???] instead of stones [???] and [???] 
instead of [???]:
 
11:4. And they said: come [???] let us make a city and a tower [???] the top 
whereof may reach to heaven; and let us make our name famous before we 
be scattered abroad into all lands.
 
11:5. And the lord came down to see the city and the tower [???] which the 
children of adam were building.
 
11:6. And he said: behold [???] it is one people [???] and all have one tongue:
and they have begun to do this [???] neither will they leave off from their 
designs [???] till they accomplish them in deed.
 
11:7. Come ye [???] therefore [???] let us go down [???] and there confound their 
tongue [???] that they may not understand one another's speech.
 
11:8. And so the lord scattered them from that place into all lands [???] and 
they ceased to build the city.
 
11:9. And therefore the name thereof was called [???] [???] because there the 
language of the whole earth was confounded: and from thence the lord 
scattered them abroad upon the face of all countries.

father of [???] and father of [???].

son [???] and [???] his daughter-in-law [???] the wife of [???] his son [???] and 
brought them out of ur of the [???] [???] to go into the land of [???]:

[???] chapter 12
 
the call of [???] [???] and the promise made to him. He [???] in 
[???] [???] and then by occasion of a [???] [???] [???] down to egypt.
 
12:1. And the lord said to [???]: go forth out of thy country [???] and from 
thy kindred [???] and out of thy father's house [???] and come into the land which 
i shall [???] thee.
 
12:2. And i will make of thee a great nation [???] and i will bless thee [???] and 
[???] thy name [???] and thou shalt be blessed.
 
12:3. I will bless them that bless thee [???] and curse them that curse thee [???] 
and in thee shall all the [???] of the earth be blessed.
 
12:4. So [???] went out as the lord had commanded him [???] and lot went with 
him: [???] was [???]-five years old when he went forth from [???].
 
12:5. And he took [???] his wife [???] and lot his brother's son [???] and all the 
substance which they had [???] [???] and the souls which they had [???] 
in [???]: and they went out to go into the land of [???]. And when 
they were come into it [???] 
 
12:6. [???] passed through the country unto the place of [???] [???] as far 
as the noble [???]: now the [???] was at that time in the land.
 
12:7. And the lord appeared to [???] [???] and said to him: to thy seed will 
i give this land. And he built there an altar to the lord [???] who had 
appeared to him.
 
12:8. And passing on from thence to a mountain [???] that was on the east 
side of [???] [???] he there [???] his tent [???] having [???] on the west [???] 
and [???] on the east: he built there also an altar to the lord [???] and 
called upon his name.
 
12:9. And [???] went forward [???] going and proceeding on to the south.
 
12:10. And there came a [???] in the country: and [???] went down into 
egypt [???] to [???] there: for the [???] was very grievous in the land.
 
12:11. And when he was near to enter into egypt [???] he said to [???] his 
wife: i know that thou art a beautiful woman:
 
12:12. And that when the [???] shall see thee [???] they will say: she is 
his wife: and they will kill me [???] and keep thee.
 
12:13. Say [???] therefore [???] i pray thee [???] that thou art my sister: that i may 
be well used for thee [???] and that my soul may live for thy sake.
 
my sister... This was no lie; because she was his niece [???] being daughter 
to his brother [???] [???] and therefore [???] in the style of the [???] [???] she 
might truly be called his sister [???] as lot is called [???]'s brother [???] gen.
14. 14. See gen. 20. 12.
 
12:14. And when [???] was come into egypt [???] the [???] saw the woman 
that she was very beautiful.
 
12:15. And the princes told [???] [???] and praised her before him: and the 
woman was taken into the house of [???].
 
12:16. And they used [???] well for her sake. And he had sheep and [???] 
and he-[???] [???] and men servants [???] and maid servants [???] and she-[???] [???] and 
[???].
 
12:17. But the lord [???] [???] and his house with most grievous 
[???] for [???] [???] [???]'s wife.
 
12:18. And [???] called [???] [???] and said to him: what is this that thou 
hast done to me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
 
12:19. For what cause didst thou say [???] she was thy sister [???] that i might 
take her to my wife? now therefore there is thy wife [???] take her [???] and go 
thy way.
 
12:20. And [???] gave his men orders concerning [???]: and they led him 
away and his wife [???] and all that he had.
 
[???] chapter 13
 
[???] and lot part from each other. God's promise to [???].
 
13:1. And [???] went up out of egypt [???] he and his wife [???] and all that he 
had [???] and lot with him into the south.
 
13:2. And he was very rich in possession of gold and silver.
 
13:3. And he returned by the way [???] that he came [???] from the south to 
[???] [???] to the place where before he had [???] his tent between [???] 
and [???] [???] 
 
13:4. In the place of the altar which he had made before [???] and there he 
called upon the name of the lord.
 
13:5. But lot also [???] who was with [???] [???] had [???] of sheep [???] and [???] 
of beasts [???] and tents.
 
13:6. Neither was the land able to bear them [???] that they might dwell 
together: for their substance was great [???] and they could not dwell 
together.
 
13:7. Whereupon also there arose a strife between the [???] of [???] 
and of lot. And at that time the [???] and the [???] [???] in 
that country.
 
13:8. [???] therefore said to lot: let there be no quarrel [???] i beseech 
thee [???] between me and thee [???] and between my [???] and thy [???]: for 
we are brethren.
 
13:9. Behold the whole land is before thee: depart from me [???] i pray thee:
if thou wilt go to the left hand [???] i will take the right: if thou choose 
the right hand [???] i will pass to the left.
 
13:10. And lot [???] up his eyes [???] saw all the country about the 
[???] [???] which was [???] throughout [???] before the lord destroyed [???] 
and [???] [???] as the paradise of the lord [???] and like egypt as one comes 
to [???].
 
13:11. And lot chose to himself the country about the [???] [???] and he 
departed from the east: and they were [???] one brother from the 
other.
 
13:12. [???] [???] in the land of [???]: and lot [???] in the towns [???] 
that were about the [???] [???] and [???] in [???].
 
13:13. And the men of [???] were very wicked [???] and [???] before the 
face of the lord beyond measure.
 
13:14. And the lord said to [???] [???] after lot was [???] from him:
lift up thy eyes [???] and look from the place wherein thou now art [???] to the 
north and to the south [???] to the east and to the west.
 
13:15. All the land which thou seest [???] i will give to thee [???] and to thy 
seed for ever.
 
13:16. And i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: if any man be 
able to number the dust of the earth [???] he shall be able to number thy 
seed also.
 
13:17. Arise and walk through the land in the length [???] and the [???] 
thereof: for i will give it to thee.
 
13:18. So [???] [???] his tent [???] came [???] and [???] by the [???] of 
[???] [???] which is in [???]: and he built there an altar to the lord.

[???] year they [???] from him.

there: and they that remained [???] fled to the mountain.
 
of [???]. [???]... This was a kind of pitch [???] which served for [???] 
in the building of [???] [???] gen. 11. 3[???] and was used by [???] in [???] the

14:11. And they took all the substance of the [???] [???] and

14:12. And lot also [???] the son of [???]'s brother [???] who [???] in [???] [???] and

14:13. And behold one [???] that had escaped [???] told [???] the [???] [???] who 
[???] in the [???] of [???] the [???] [???] the brother of [???] [???] and the 
brother of [???]: for these had made a league with [???].

[???] them: and pursued them as far as [???] [???] which is on the left 
hand of [???].
 
14:16. And he brought back all the substance [???] and lot his brother [???] with 
his substance [???] the women also [???] and the people.
 
14:17. And the king of [???] went out to meet him [???] after he returned 
from the slaughter of [???] [???] and of the kings that were with him 
in the [???] of save [???] which is the king's [???].

reward exceeding great.
 
15:2. And [???] said: lord god [???] what wilt thou give me? i shall go 
without children: and the son of the steward of my house is this 
[???] [???].
 
15:3. And [???] added: but to me thou hast not given seed: and lo my 
servant born in my house [???] shall be my heir.
 
15:4. And immediately the word of the lord came to him [???] saying: he 
shall not be thy heir: but he that shall come out of thy bowels [???] him 
shalt thou have for thy heir.
 
15:5. And he brought him forth abroad [???] and said to him: look up to 
heaven and number the stars if thou canst. And he said to him: so shall 
thy seed be.
 
15:6. [???] believed god [???] and it was [???] to him unto justice.
 
15:7. And he said to him: i am the lord who brought thee out from ur of 
the [???] [???] to give thee this land [???] and that thou [???] possess it.
 
15:8. But he said: lord god [???] whereby may i know that i shall possess it?
 
15:9. And the lord answered [???] and said: take me a cow of three years old [???] 
and a she-[???] of three years [???] and a ram of three years [???] a [???] also [???]

away.
 
15:12. And when the sun was setting [???] a deep sleep fell upon [???] [???] and a 
great and [???] horror seized upon him.
 
15:13. And it was said unto him: know thou beforehand that thy seed 
shall be a stranger in a land not their own [???] and they shall bring them 
under bondage [???] and afflict them four hundred years.
 
15:14. But i will judge the nation which they shall serve [???] and after 
this they shall come out with great substance.
 
15:15. And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace [???] and be buried in a 
good old age.
 
15:16. But in the fourth generation they shall return hither: for as yet 
the [???] of the [???] are not at the full until this present 
time.
 
15:17. And when the sun was set [???] there arose a dark mist [???] and there 
appeared a smoking [???] [???] and a lamp of fire passing between those 
[???].
 
15:18. That day god made a [???] with [???] [???] saying: to thy seed will 
i give this land [???] from the river to egypt even to the great river

thy own hand [???] use her as it pleaseth thee. And when [???] [???] her [???] 
she ran away.
 
16:7. And the angel of the lord having found her [???] by a fountain of water 
in the wilderness [???] which is in the way to sur in the desert [???] 
 
16:8. He said to her: [???] [???] [???] of [???] [???] whence [???] thou? and 
whither goest thou? and she answered: i [???] from the face of [???] [???] my 
mistress.
 
16:9. And the angel of the lord said to her: return to thy mistress [???] and 
humble thyself under her hand.
 
16:10. And again he said: i will [???] thy seed exceedingly [???] and it 
shall not be [???] for multitude.
 
16:11. And again: behold [???] said he [???] thou art with child [???] and thou shalt 
bring forth a son: and thou shalt call his name [???] [???] because the lord 
hath heard thy affliction.
 
16:12. He shall be a wild man: his hand will be against all men [???] and all 
men's hands against him: and he shall pitch his tents over against all 
his brethren.
 
16:13. And she called the name of the lord that spoke unto her: thou the 
god who hast seen me. For she said: verily [???] here have i seen the hinder 
parts of him that [???] me.
 
16:14. Therefore she called that well [???] the well of him that [???] and 
[???] me. The same is between [???] and [???].
 
16:15. And [???] brought forth a son to [???]: who called his name 
[???].
 
16:16. [???] was four score and six years old when [???] brought him 
forth [???].
 
[???] chapter 17
 
the [???] of [???].
 
17:1. And after he began to be [???] and nine years old [???] the lord 
appeared to him: and said unto him: i am the [???] god: walk before 
me [???] and be perfect.
 
17:2. And i will make my [???] between me and thee: and i will 
[???] thee exceedingly.
 
17:3. [???] fell flat on his face.
 
17:4. And god said to him: i am [???] and my [???] is with thee [???] and thou 
shalt be a father of many [???].
 
17:5. Neither shall thy name be called any more [???]: but thou shalt be 
called [???]: because i have made thee a father of many [???].
 
[???]... In the [???] [???] [???] a high father: but [???] [???] the father 
of the multitude; [???] [???] my lady [???] but [???] [???] lady.
 
17:6. And i will make thee increase exceedingly [???] and i will make [???] 
of thee [???] and kings shall come out of thee.
 
17:7. And i will establish my [???] between me and thee [???] and between 
thy seed after thee in their [???] [???] by a perpetual [???]: to be 
a god to thee [???] and to thy seed after thee.
 
17:8. And i will give to thee [???] and to thy seed [???] the land of thy 
[???] [???] all the land of [???] [???] for a perpetual possession [???] and i 
will be their god.
 
17:9. Again god said to [???]: and thou therefore shalt keep my 
[???] [???] and thy seed after thee in their [???].
 
17:10. This is my [???] which you shall observe between me and you [???] 
and thy seed after thee: all the male-kind of you shall be [???].
 
17:11. And you shall [???] the flesh of your [???] [???] that it may 
be for a sign of the [???] between me and you.
 
17:12. An infant of eight days old shall be [???] among you [???] every 
[???] in your [???]: he that is born in the house [???] as well as 
the bought servant [???] shall be [???] [???] and [???] is not of your 
stock:
 
17:13. And my [???] shall be in your flesh for a perpetual [???].
 
17:14. The male whose flesh of his [???] shall not be [???] [???] 
that soul shall be destroyed out of his people: because he hath broken 
my [???].
 
17:15. God said also to [???]: [???] thy wife thou shalt not call 
[???] [???] but [???].
 
17:16. And i will bless her [???] and of her i will give thee a son [???] whom i 
will bless [???] and he shall become [???] [???] and kings of people shall 
spring from him.
 
17:17. [???] fell upon his face [???] and laughed [???] saying in his heart:
shall a son [???] [???] thou [???] be born to him that is a hundred years old?
and shall [???] that is [???] years old bring forth?
 
17:18. And he said to god: o that [???] may live before thee.
 
17:19. And god said to [???]: [???] thy wife shall bear thee a son [???] and 
thou shalt call his name [???] [???] and i will establish my [???] with 
him for a perpetual [???] [???] and with his seed after him.
 
17:20. And as for [???] i have also heard thee. Behold [???] i will bless 
him [???] and increase [???] and [???] him exceedingly: he shall beget twelve 
[???] [???] and i will make him a great nation.
 
17:21. But my [???] i will establish with [???] [???] whom [???] shall 
bring forth to thee at this time in the next year.
 
17:22. And when he had left off speaking with him [???] god went up from 
[???].
 
17:23. And [???] took [???] his son [???] and all that were born in his 
house: and all whom he had bought [???] every male among the men of his 
house: and he [???] the flesh of their [???] forthwith the very 
same day [???] as god had commanded him.
 
17:24. [???] was [???] and nine years old [???] when he [???] the 
flesh of his [???].
 
17:25. And [???] his son was full [???] years old at the time of his 
[???].
 
17:26. The [???] day was [???] [???] and [???] his son.
 
17:27. And all the men of his house [???] as well they that were born in his 
house [???] as the bought servants and strangers [???] were [???] with him.
 
[???] chapter 18
 
angels are [???] by [???]. They [???] the birth of [???].
[???]'s prayer for the men of [???].
 
18:1. And the lord appeared to him in the [???] of [???] as he was 
sitting at the door of his tent [???] in the very heat of the day.
 
18:2. And when he had lifted up his eyes [???] there appeared to him three 
men standing near to him: and as soon as he saw them [???] he ran to meet 
them from the door of his tent [???] and [???] down to the ground.
 
18:3. And he said: lord [???] if i have found favour in thy sight [???] pass not 
away from thy servant.
 
18:4. But i will fetch a little water [???] and wash ye your feet [???] and rest 
ye under the tree.
 
18:5. And i will set a [???] of bread [???] and [???] ye your heart [???] 
afterwards you shall pass on: for therefore are you come aside to your 
servant. And they said: do as thou hast spoken.
 
18:6. [???] made haste into the tent to [???] [???] and said to her: make 
haste [???] temper together three measures of [???] [???] and make [???] upon the 
hearth.
 
18:7. And he himself ran to the herd [???] and took from thence a calf [???] very 
tender and very good [???] and gave it to a young man [???] who made haste and 
[???] it.
 
18:8. He took also butter and milk [???] and the calf which he had [???] [???] 
and set before them: but he stood by them under the tree.
 
18:9. And when they had eaten [???] they said to him: where is [???] thy wife?
he answered: lo she is in the tent.
 
18:10. And he said to him: i will return and come to thee at this time [???] 
life [???] [???] and [???] [???] thy wife [???] shall have a son. Which when [???] 
heard [???] she laughed behind the door of the tent.
 
18:11. Now they were both old [???] and far [???] in years [???] and it had 
ceased to be with [???] after the manner of women.
 
18:12. And she laughed secretly [???] saying: after i am grown old [???] and my 
lord is an old man [???] shall i give myself to pleasure?
 
18:13. And the lord said to [???]: why did [???] laugh [???] saying: shall 
i [???] who am an old woman [???] bear a child indeed?
 
18:14. Is there any thing hard to god? according to appointment i will 
return to thee at this same time [???] life [???] [???] and [???] shall have 
a son.
 
18:15. [???] denied [???] saying: i did not laugh: for she was afraid. But the 
lord said: nay; but thou didst laugh.
 
18:16. And when the men rose up from thence [???] they turned their eyes 
towards [???]: and [???] walked with them [???] bringing them on the way.
 
18:17. And the lord said: can i hide from [???] what i am about to do:
 
18:18. Seeing he shall become a great and mighty nation [???] and in him all 
the [???] of the earth shall be blessed?
 
18:19. For i know that he will command his children [???] and his household 
after him [???] to keep the way of the lord [???] and do judgment and justice:
that for [???]'s sake [???] the lord may bring to effect all the things he 
hath spoken unto him.
 
18:20. And the lord said: the cry of [???] and [???] is [???] [???] 
and their sin is become exceedingly grievous.
 
18:21. I will go down and see whether they have done according to the 
cry that is come to me; or whether it be not so [???] that i may know.
 
i will go down [???] etc... The lord here [???] his discourse to the 
way of speaking and [???] amongst men; for he [???] all things [???] and 
[???] not to go anywhere for information. Note here [???] that two of the 
three angels went away immediately for [???]; whilst the third [???] who 
[???] the lord [???] remained with [???].
 
18:22. And they turned themselves from thence [???] and went their way to 
[???]: but [???] as yet stood before the lord.
 
18:23. And drawing nigh [???] he said: wilt thou destroy the just with the 
wicked?
 
18:24. If there be fifty just men in the city [???] shall they perish withal?
and wilt thou not spare that place for the sake of the fifty just [???] if 
they be therein?
 
18:25. Far be it from thee to do this thing [???] and to slay the just with 
the wicked [???] and for the just to be in like case as the wicked; this is 
not [???] thee: thou who [???] all the earth [???] wilt not make this 
judgment.
 
18:26. And the lord said to him: if i find in [???] fifty just within 
the city [???] i will spare the whole place for their sake.
 
18:27. And [???] answered [???] and said: seeing i have once begun [???] i will 
speak to my lord [???] whereas i am dust and ashes.
 
18:28. What if there be five less than fifty just persons? wilt thou for 
five and forty destroy the whole city: and he said: i will not destroy 
it [???] if i find five and forty.
 
18:29. And again he said to him: but if forty be found there [???] what wilt 
thou do? he said: i will not destroy it for the sake of forty.
 
18:30. Lord [???] [???] he [???] be not angry [???] i beseech thee [???] if i speak: what if 
thirty shall be found there? he answered: i will not do it [???] if i find 
thirty there.
 
18:31. Seeing [???] [???] he [???] i have once begun [???] i will speak to my lord:
what if twenty be found there? he said: i will not destroy it for the 
sake of twenty.
 
18:32. I beseech thee [???] [???] he [???] be not angry [???] lord [???] if i speak yet once 
more: what if ten shall be found there? and he said: i will not destroy 
it for the sake of ten.
 
18:33. And the lord departed [???] after he had left speaking to [???]: and 
[???] returned to his place.
 
[???] chapter 19
 
lot [???] [???] angels in his house [???] is delivered from [???] [???] which is 
destroyed: his wife for looking back is turned into a statue of salt.
 
19:1. And the two angels came to [???] in the evening [???] and lot was 
sitting in the gate of the city. And seeing them [???] he rose up and went to 
meet them: and [???] [???] to the ground.
 
19:2. And said: i beseech you [???] my lords [???] turn in to the house of your 
servant [???] and lodge there: wash your feet [???] and in the morning you shall 
go on your way. And they said: no [???] but we will abide in the street.
 
19:3. He pressed them very much to turn in unto him: and when they were 
come into his house [???] he made them a feast [???] and [???] [???] bread [???] 
and they ate:
 
19:4. But before they went to bed [???] the men of the city [???] the house [???] 
both young and old [???] all the people together.
 
19:5. And they called lot [???] and said to him: where are the men that came 
in to thee at night? bring them out hither [???] that we may know them:
 
19:6. Lot went out to them [???] and shut the door after him [???] and said:
 
19:7. Do not so [???] i beseech you [???] my brethren [???] do not commit this evil.
 
19:8. I have two daughters who [???] as yet [???] have not known man; i will bring 
them out to you [???] and abuse you them as it shall please you [???] so that you 
do no evil to these men [???] because they are come in under the shadow of my 
roof.
 
19:9. But they said: get thee back thither. And again: thou [???] in [???] 
said they [???] as a stranger [???] was it to be a judge? therefore we will 
afflict thee more than them. And they pressed very violently upon lot:
and they were even at the point of breaking open the doors.
 
19:10. And behold the men put out their hand [???] and drew in lot unto them [???] 
and shut the door.
 
19:11. And them [???] that were without [???] they struck with [???] from the 
least to the greatest [???] so that they could not find the door.
 
19:12. And they said to lot: hast thou here any of thine? son-in-law [???] or 
sons [???] or daughters [???] all that are thine bring them out of this city:
 
19:13. For we will destroy this place [???] because their cry is grown loud 
before the lord [???] who hath sent us to destroy them.
 
19:14. So lot went out [???] and spoke to his sons-in-law that were to have 
his daughters [???] and said: arise: get you out of this place [???] because the 
lord will destroy this city. And he seemed to them to speak as it were 
in jest.
 
19:15. And when it was morning [???] the angels pressed him [???] saying: arise [???] 
take thy wife [???] and the two daughters that thou hast: lest thou also 
perish in the [???] of the city.
 
19:16. And as he [???] [???] they took his hand [???] and the hand of his wife [???] 
and of his two daughters [???] because the lord [???] him.
 
19:17. And they brought him forth [???] and set him without the city: and 
there they spoke to him [???] saying: save thy life: look not back [???] neither 
stay thou in all the country about: but save thy self in the mountain [???] 
lest thou be also [???].
 
19:18. And lot said to them: i beseech thee [???] my lord [???] 
 
19:19. Because thy servant hath found grace before thee [???] and thou hast 
[???] thy mercy [???] which thou hast [???] to me [???] in saving my life [???] and 
i cannot escape to the mountain [???] lest some evil seize me [???] and i die.
 
19:20. There is this city here at hand [???] to which i may [???] [???] it is a 
little one [???] and i shall be saved in it: is it not a little one [???] and my 
soul shall live?
 
19:21. And he said to him: behold also in this [???] i have heard thy 
prayers [???] not to destroy the city for which thou hast spoken.
 
19:22. Make haste [???] and be saved there: because i cannot do any thing 
till thou go in thither. Therefore the name of that city was called 
[???].
 
[???]... That is [???] a little one.
 
19:23. The sun was risen upon the earth [???] and lot entered into [???].
 
19:24. And the lord [???] upon [???] and [???] [???] and fire 
from the lord out of heaven.
 
19:25. And he destroyed these cities [???] and all the country about [???] all the 
[???] of the cities [???] and all things that spring from the earth.
 
19:26. And his wife looking behind her [???] was turned into a statue of 
salt.
 
and his wife... As a standing [???] to the servants of god to proceed 
in virtue [???] and not to look back to vice or its [???].
 
19:27. And [???] got up early in the morning [???] and in the place where 
he had stood before with the lord:
 
19:28. He looked towards [???] and [???] [???] and the whole land of that 
country: and he saw the ashes rise up from the earth as the smoke of a 
[???].
 
19:29. Now when god destroyed the cities of that country [???] [???] 
[???] [???] he delivered lot out of the destruction of the cities wherein 
he had [???].
 
19:30. And lot went up out of [???] [???] and [???] in the mountain [???] and his 
two daughters with him (for he was afraid to stay in [???]) and he [???] 
in a cave [???] he and his two daughters with him.
 
19:31. And the elder said to the younger: our father is old [???] and there 
is no man left on the earth [???] to come in unto us after the manner of the 
whole earth.
 
19:32. Come [???] let us make him drunk with wine [???] and let us lie with him [???] 
that we may preserve seed of our father.
 
19:33. And they made their father drink wine that night: and the elder 
went in [???] and lay with her father: but he perceived not [???] neither when his 
daughter lay down [???] nor when she rose up.
 
19:34. And the next day the elder said to the younger: behold i lay last 
night with my father [???] let us make him drink wine also to night [???] and thou 
shalt lie with him [???] that we may save seed of our father.
 
19:35. They made their father drink wine that night also [???] and the 
younger daughter went in [???] and lay with him: and neither then did he 
perceive when she lay down [???] nor when she rose up.
 
19:36. So the two daughters of lot were with child by their father.
 
19:37. And the elder bore a son [???] and she called his name [???]: he is the 
father of the [???] unto this day.
 
19:38. The younger also bore a son [???] and she called his name [???]; that 
is [???] the son of my people: he is the father of the [???] unto this 
day.
 
[???] chapter 20
 
[???] [???] in [???]: [???] is taken into king [???]'s house [???] 
but by god's commandment is [???] [???].
 
20:1. [???] removed from thence to the south country [???] and [???] 
between [???] and sur [???] and [???] in [???].
 
20:2. And he said of [???] his wife: she is my sister. So [???] the 
king of [???] sent [???] and took her.
 
20:3. And god came to [???] in a dream by night [???] and he said to him:
lo thou shalt die for the woman that thou hast taken: for she hath a 
husband.
 
20:4. Now [???] had not touched her [???] and he said: lord [???] wilt thou 
slay a nation that is ignorant and just?
 
20:5. Did not he say to me: she is my sister: and she say [???] he is my 
brother? in the simplicity of my heart [???] and [???] of my hands have i 
done this.
 
20:6. And god said to him: and i know that thou didst it with a [???] 
heart: and therefore i [???] thee from [???] against me [???] and i 
suffered thee not to touch her.
 
20:7. Now therefore restore the man his wife [???] for he is a prophet: and 
he shall pray for thee [???] and thou shalt live: but if thou wilt not 
restore her [???] know that thou shalt surely die [???] thou and all that are 
thine.
 
20:8. And [???] forthwith rising up in the night [???] called all his 
servants: and spoke all these words in their hearing [???] and all the men 
were exceedingly afraid.
 
20:9. And [???] called also for [???] [???] and said to him: what hast 
thou done to us? what have we offended thee in [???] that thou hast brought 
upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done to us what thou 
[???] not to do.
 
20:10. And again he [???] with him [???] and said: what [???] thou [???] 
that thou hast done this?
 
20:11. [???] answered: i thought with myself [???] saying: perhaps there is 
not the fear of god in this place: and they will kill me for the sake of 
my wife:
 
20:12. [???] [???] otherwise also she is truly my sister [???] the daughter of 
my father [???] and not the daughter of my mother [???] and i took her to wife.
 
20:13. And after god brought me out of my father's house [???] i said to her:
thou shalt do me this kindness: in every place [???] to which we shall come [???] 
thou shalt say that i am thy brother.
 
20:14. And [???] took sheep and [???] [???] and servants and [???] [???] 
and gave to [???]: and [???] to him [???] his wife [???] 
 
20:15. And said: the land is before you [???] dwell [???] it shall 
please thee.
 
20:16. And to [???] he said: behold i have given thy brother a thousand 
pieces of silver [???] this shall serve thee for a covering of thy eyes to 
all that are with thee [???] and [???] thou shalt go: and remember 
thou wast taken.
 
20:17. And when [???] [???] [???] god [???] [???] and his wife [???] and 
his [???] [???] and they bore children:
 
20:18. For the lord had closed up every womb of the house of [???] [???] 
on account of [???] [???] [???]'s wife.
 
[???] chapter 21
 
[???] is born. [???] and [???] are cast forth.
 
21:1. And the lord visited [???] [???] as he had promised: and [???] what 
he had spoken.
 
21:2. And she [???] and bore a son in her old age [???] at the time that 
god had [???] her.
 
21:3. And [???] called the name of his son [???] whom [???] bore him [???] [???].
 
[???]... This word [???] laughter.
 
21:4. And he [???] him the [???] day [???] as god had commanded him [???] 
 
21:5. When he was a hundred years old: for at this age of his father [???] 
was [???] born.
 
21:6. And [???] said: god hath made a laughter for me: [???] shall 
hear of it will laugh with me.
 
21:7. And again she said: who would believe that [???] should hear 
that [???] gave suck to a son [???] whom she bore to him in his old age?
 
21:8. And the child grew [???] and was [???]: and [???] made a great feast 
on the day of his [???].
 
21:9. And when [???] had seen the son of [???] [???] the egyptian [???] playing with 
[???] [???] her son [???] she said to [???]:
 
21:10. Cast out this [???] and her son; for the son of the [???] 
shall not be heir with my son [???].
 
21:11. [???] took this [???] for his son.
 
21:12. And god said to him: let it not seem grievous to thee for the 
boy [???] and for thy [???]: in all that [???] hath said to thee [???] [???] 
to her voice: for in [???] shall thy seed be called.
 
21:13. But i will make the son also of the [???] a great nation [???] 
because he is thy seed.
 
21:14. So [???] rose up in the morning [???] and taking bread and a bottle 
of water [???] put it upon her shoulder [???] and delivered the boy [???] and sent her 
away. And she departed [???] and [???] in the wilderness of [???].
 
21:15. And when the water in the bottle was spent [???] she cast the boy 
under one of the trees that were there.
 
21:16. And she went her way [???] and sat over against him a great way off [???] as 
far as a bow can carry [???] for she said: i will not see the boy die: and 
sitting over against [???] she lifted up her voice and wept.
 
21:17. And god heard the voice of the boy: and an angel of god called to 
[???] from heaven [???] saying: what art thou doing [???] [???]? fear not; for god 
hath heard the voice of the boy [???] from the place wherein he is.
 
21:18. Arise [???] take up the boy [???] and hold him by the hand [???] for i will make 
him a great nation.
 
21:19. And god opened her eyes: and she saw a well of water [???] and went 
and filled the bottle [???] and gave the boy to drink.
 
21:20. And god was with him: and he grew [???] and [???] in the wilderness [???] 
and became a young man [???] an [???].
 
21:21. And he [???] in the wilderness of [???] [???] and his mother took a 
wife for him out of the land of egypt.
 
21:22. At the same time [???] [???] and [???] the general of his army [???] 
said to [???]: god is with thee in all that thou dost.
 
21:23. Swear therefore by god [???] that thou wilt not hurt me [???] nor my 
posterity [???] nor my stock: but according to the kindness that i have done 
to thee [???] thou shalt do to me [???] and to the land wherein thou hast lived a 
stranger.
 
21:24. And [???] said: i will swear.
 
21:25. And he [???] [???] for a well of water [???] which his servants 
had taken away by force.
 
21:26. And [???] answered: i knew not who did this thing: and thou 
didst not tell me [???] and i heard not of it till today.
 
21:27. Then [???] took sheep and [???] [???] and gave them to [???]: and 
both of them made a league.
 
21:28. And [???] set apart seven [???] of the flock.
 
21:29. And [???] said to him: what mean these seven [???] which 
thou hast set apart?
 
21:30. But he said: thou shalt take seven [???] at my hand: that they 
may be a testimony for me [???] that i [???] this well.
 
21:31. Therefore that place was called [???]; because there both of 
them did swear.
 
[???]... That is [???] the well of oath.
 
21:32. And they made a league for the well of oath.
 
21:33. And [???] and [???] [???] the general of his army [???] arose and 
returned to the land of the [???]. But [???] planted a grove in 
[???] [???] and there called upon the name of the lord god eternal.
 
21:34. And he was a [???] in the land of the [???] many days.
 
[???] chapter 22
 
the faith and obedience of [???] is proved in his readiness to 
sacrifice his son [???]. He is [???] from the act by an angel. Former 
promises are [???] to him. His brother [???]'s issue.
 
22:1. After these things [???] god tempted [???] [???] and said to him: [???] [???] 
[???]. And he answered: here i am.
 
god tempted [???] etc... God [???] no man to evil [???] [???] 1. 13; but by 
trial and [???] [???] known to the world [???] and to ourselves [???] what 
we are [???] as here by this trial the singular faith and obedience of 
[???] was made manifest.
 
22:2. He said to him: take thy only [???] son [???] [???] whom thou 
[???] [???] and go into the land of vision; and there thou shalt offer him 
for an [???] upon one of the mountains which i will [???] thee.
 
22:3. So [???] rising up in the night [???] [???] his ass [???] and took with 
him two young men [???] and [???] his son: and when he had cut wood for the 
[???] [???] he went his way to the place which god had commanded him.
 
22:4. And on the third day [???] [???] up his eyes [???] he saw the place afar 
off.
 
22:5. And he said to his young men: stay you here with the ass; i and 
the boy will go with speed as far as yonder [???] and after we have 
[???] [???] will return to you.
 
22:6. And he took the wood for the [???] [???] and laid it upon [???] his 
son; and he himself carried in his hands fire and a sword. And as they 
two went on together [???] 
 
22:7. [???] said to his father: my father. And he answered: what wilt 
thou [???] son? behold [???] [???] he [???] fire and wood: where is the [???] for the 
[???]?
 
22:8. And [???] said: god will provide himself a [???] for an 
[???] [???] my son. So they went on together.
 
22:9. And they came to the place which god had [???] him [???] where he built 
an altar [???] and laid the wood in order upon it; and when he had bound 
[???] his son [???] he laid him on the altar upon the pile of wood.
 
22:10. And he put forth his hand [???] and took the sword [???] to sacrifice his 
son.
 
22:11. And behold [???] an angel of the lord from heaven called to him [???] 
saying: [???] [???] [???]. And he answered: here i am.
 
22:12. And he said to him: lay not thy hand upon the boy [???] neither do 
thou any thing to him: now i know that thou [???] god [???] and hast not 
[???] thy only [???] son for my sake.
 
22:13. [???] lifted up his eyes [???] and saw behind his back a ram [???] 
amongst the [???] [???] [???] fast by the horns [???] which he took and 
offered for a [???] instead of his son.
 
22:14. And he called the name of that place [???] the lord [???]. Whereupon [???] 
even to this day [???] it is said: in the mountain the lord will see.
 
22:15. And the angel of the lord called to [???] a second time from 
heaven [???] saying:
 
22:16. By my own self have i sworn [???] [???] the lord: because thou hast 
done this thing [???] and hast not [???] thy only [???] son for my sake:
 
22:17. I will bless thee [???] and i will [???] thy seed as the stars of 
heaven [???] and as the sand that is by the sea shore; thy seed shall possess 
the gates of their enemies.
 
22:18. And in thy seed shall all the [???] of the earth be blessed [???] 
because thou hast [???] my voice.
 
22:19. [???] returned to his young men [???] and they went to [???] 
together [???] and he [???] there.
 
22:20. After these things [???] it was told [???] [???] that [???] also had 
borne children to [???] his brother.
 
22:21. Hus [???] the [???] [???] and [???] [???] his brother [???] and [???] the father 
of the [???] [???]

23:3. And after he rose up from the funeral [???] [???] he spoke to the 
children of [???] [???] saying:
 
23:4. I am a stranger and [???] among you: give me the right of a 
[???] place with you [???] that i may bury my dead.

in our principal [???]: and no man shall have power to hinder thee 
from [???] thy dead in his [???].
 
23:7. [???] rose up [???] and [???] down to the people of the land [???] to wit [???] 
the children of [???]:
 
[???] down to the people... [???] [???] [???] [???]. But this word 
here [???] as well as in many other places in the [???] [???] [???] is used 
to signify only an inferior honour and reverence paid to men [???] expressed 
by a [???] down of the body.
 
23:8. And said to them: if it please your soul that i should bury my 
dead [???] hear me [???] and [???] for me to [???] the son of [???].
 
23:9. That he may give me the double cave [???] which he hath in the end of 
his field: for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me before 
you [???] for a possession of a [???] place.
 
23:10. Now [???] [???] in the midst of the children of [???]. And [???] 
made answer to [???] in the hearing of all that went in at the gate of 
the city [???] saying:
 
23:11. Let it not be so [???] my lord [???] but do thou rather [???] to what i 
say: the field i deliver to thee [???] and the cave that is therein; in the 
presence of the children of my people [???] bury thy dead.
 
23:12. [???] [???] down before the people of the land.
 
23:13. And he spoke to [???] [???] in the presence of the people: i beseech 
thee to hear me: i will give money for the field; take it [???] and so will i 
bury my dead in it.
 
23:14. And [???] answered:
 
23:15. My lord [???] hear me. The ground which thou [???] [???] is worth four 
hundred [???] of silver: this is the price between me and thee: but 
what is this? bury thy dead.
 
23:16. And when [???] had heard this [???] he [???] out the money that 
[???] had asked [???] in the hearing of the children of [???] [???] four hundred 
[???] of silver [???] of common current money.
 
23:17. And the field that before was [???]'s [???] wherein was the double 
cave [???] looking towards [???] [???] both it and the cave [???] and all the trees 
thereof [???] in all its limits round about [???] 
 
23:18. Was made sure to [???] for a possession [???] in the sight of the 
children of [???] [???] and of all that went in at the gate of his city.
 
23:19. And so [???] buried [???] [???] his wife [???] in the double cave of the 
field [???] that looked towards [???] [???] this is [???] in the land of

23:20. And the field was made sure to [???] [???] and the cave that was in

[???] chapter 24
 
[???]'s servant [???] sent by him into [???] [???] [???] from thence 
[???] [???] who is married to [???].
 
24:1. Now [???] was old [???] and [???] in age; and the lord had blessed 
him in all things.
 
24:2. And he said to the elder servant of his house [???] who was [???] over 
all he had: put thy hand under my thigh [???] 
 
24:3. That i may make thee swear by the lord [???] the god of heaven and 
earth [???] that thou take not a wife for my son [???] of the daughters of the 
[???] [???] among whom i dwell:
 
24:4. But that thou go to my own country and kindred [???] and take a wife 
from thence for my son [???].
 
24:5. The servant answered: if the woman will not come with me into this 
land [???] must i bring thy son back again to the place from whence thou 
[???] out?
 
24:6. And [???] said: beware thou never bring my son back again 
thither.
 
24:7. The lord god of heaven [???] who took me out of my father's house [???] and 
out of my native country [???] who spoke to me [???] and swore to me [???] saying: to 
thy seed will i give this land: he will send his angel before thee [???] and 
thou shalt take from thence a wife for my son.
 
he will send his angel before thee... This shows that the [???] 
believed that god gave them guardian angels for their protection.
 
24:8. But if the woman will not follow thee [???] thou shalt not be bound by 
the oath: only bring not my son back thither again.
 
24:9. The servant [???] therefore [???] put his hand under the thigh of [???] [???] 
his lord [???] and swore to him upon his word.
 
24:10. And he took ten [???] of his master's herd [???] and departed [???] 
carrying something of all his goods with him [???] and he set forward and 
went on to [???] [???] to the city of [???].
 
24:11. And when he had made the [???] lie down without the town [???] near a 
well of water [???] in the evening [???] at the time when women are wont to come 
out to draw water [???] he said:
 
24:12. O lord [???] the god of my master [???] [???] [???] meet me today [???] i beseech 
thee [???] and [???] kindness to my master [???] [???].
 
24:13. Behold [???] i stand nigh the spring of water [???] and the daughters of 
the [???] of this city will come out to draw water:
 
24:14. Now [???] therefore [???] the maid to whom i shall say: let down thy 
[???] that i may drink: and she shall answer [???] drink [???] and i will give 
thy [???] drink also: let it be the same whom thou hast provided for 
thy servant [???]: and by this [???] i shall understand that thou hast [???] 
kindness to my master.
 
24:15. He had not yet ended these words within himself [???] and behold 
[???] came out [???] the daughter of [???] [???] son of [???] [???] wife to [???] 
the brother of [???] [???] having a [???] on her shoulder:
 
24:16. An exceeding [???] maid [???] and a most beautiful virgin [???] and not 
known to man: and she went down to the spring [???] and filled her [???] [???] 
and was coming back.
 
24:17. And the servant ran to meet her [???] and said: give me a little water 
to drink of thy [???].
 
24:18. And she answered: drink [???] my lord. And quickly she let down the 
[???] upon her arm [???] and gave him drink.
 
24:19. And when he had drunk [???] she said: i will draw water for thy [???] 
also [???] till they all drink.
 
24:20. And [???] out the [???] into the [???] [???] she ran back to the 
well to draw water; and having drawn [???] she gave to all the [???].
 
24:21. But he [???] [???] beheld her with silence [???] [???] to know whether 
the lord had made his journey prosperous or not.
 
24:22. And after that the [???] had drunk [???] the man took out golden 
[???] [???] [???] two [???]; and as many [???] [???] of ten [???] 
weight.
 
24:23. And he said to her: whose daughter art thou? tell me: is there 
any place in thy father's house to lodge?
 
24:24. And she answered: i am the daughter of [???] [???] the son of 
[???] [???] whom she bore to [???].
 
24:25. And she said [???] moreover [???] to him: we have good store of both straw 
and hay [???] and a large place to lodge in.
 
24:26. The man [???] himself down [???] and [???] the lord [???] 
 
24:27. Saying: blessed be the lord god of my master [???] [???] who hath 
not taken away his mercy and truth from my master [???] and hath brought me 
the straight way into the house of my master's brother.
 
24:28. Then the maid ran [???] and told in her mother's house all that she 
had heard.
 
24:29. And [???] had a brother [???] named [???] [???] who went out in haste to 
the man [???] to the well.
 
24:30. And when he had seen the [???] and [???] in his sister's 
hands [???] and had heard all that she [???] [???] saying [???] thus and thus the man 
spoke to me: he came to the man who stood by the [???] [???] and near to the 
spring of water [???] 
 
24:31. And said to him: come in [???] thou blessed of the lord; why [???] 
thou without? i have prepared the house [???] and a place for the [???].
 
24:32. And he brought him into his lodging; and he [???] the 
[???] [???] and gave straw and hay [???] and water to wash his feet [???] and the feet 
of the men that were come with him.
 
24:33. And bread was set before him. But he said: i will not eat [???] till i 
tell my message. He answered him: speak.
 
24:34. And he said: i am the servant of [???]:
 
24:35. And the lord hath blessed my master [???] [???] and he is become 
great: and he hath given him sheep and [???] [???] silver and gold [???] men 
servants and women servants [???] [???] and [???].
 
24:36. And [???] [???] my master's wife [???] hath borne my master a son in her old 
age [???] and he hath given him all that he had.
 
24:37. And my master made me swear [???] saying: thou shalt not take a wife 
for my son of the [???] [???] in whose land i dwell:
 
24:38. But thou shalt go to my father's house [???] and shalt take a wife of 
my own kindred for my son:
 
24:39. But i answered my master: what if the woman will not come with 
me?
 
24:40. The lord [???] said he [???] in whose sight i walk [???] will send his angel 
with thee [???] and will direct thy way: and thou shalt take a wife for my 
son of my own kindred [???] and of my father's house.
 
24:41. But thou shalt be clear from my curse [???] when thou shalt come to my 
kindred [???] if they will not give thee one.
 
24:42. And i came today to the well of water [???] and said: o lord god of my 
master [???] [???] [???] if thou hast [???] my way [???] wherein i now walk [???] 
 
24:43. Behold [???] i stand by the well of water [???] and the virgin [???] that shall 
come out to draw water [???] who shall hear me say: give me a little water to 
drink of thy [???]:
 
24:44. And shall say to me: both drink thou [???] and i will also draw for 
thy [???]: let the same be the woman [???] whom the lord hath prepared for 
my master's son.
 
24:45. And whilst i [???] these things secretly with myself [???] [???] 
appeared [???] coming with a [???] [???] which she carried on her shoulder: and 
she went down to the well and drew water. And i said to her: give me a 
little to drink.
 
24:46. And she speedily let down the [???] from her shoulder [???] and said 
to me: both drink thou [???] and to thy [???] i will give drink. I drank [???] 
and she [???] the [???].
 
24:47. And i asked her [???] and said: whose daughter art thou? and she 
answered: i am the daughter of [???] [???] the son of [???] [???] whom [???] 
bore to him. So i put [???] on her to [???] her face [???] and i put 
[???] on her hands.
 
24:48. And falling down [???] i [???] the lord [???] blessing the lord god of my 
master [???] [???] [???] who hath brought me the straight way to take the 
daughter of my master's brother for his son.
 
24:49. Wherefore [???] if you do according to mercy and truth with my master [???] 
tell me: but if it please you otherwise [???] tell me that also [???] that i may 
go to the right hand [???] or to the left.
 
24:50. And [???] and [???] answered: the word hath proceeded from the 
lord: we cannot speak any other thing to thee but his pleasure.
 
24:51. Behold [???] [???] is before thee [???] take her and go thy way [???] and let 
her be the wife of thy master's son [???] as the lord hath spoken.
 
24:52. Which when [???]'s servant heard [???] falling down to the ground [???] 
he [???] the lord.
 
24:53. And bringing forth [???] of silver and gold [???] and garments [???] he 
gave them to [???] [???] for a present. He offered gifts also to her 
brothers [???] and to her mother.
 
24:54. And a banquet was made [???] and they ate and drank together [???] and 
[???] there. And in the morning [???] the servant arose [???] and said: let me 
depart [???] that i may go to my master.
 
24:55. And her brother and mother answered: let the maid stay [???] at least [???] 
ten days with us [???] and afterwards she shall depart.
 
24:56. Stay me not [???] said he [???] because the lord hath [???] my way:
send me away [???] that i may go to my master.
 
24:57. And they said: let us call the maid [???] and ask her will.
 
let us call the maid [???] and ask her will... Not as to her marriage [???] as she 
had already [???] [???] but of her [???] her parents and going to her 
husband.
 
24:58. And they called her [???] and when she was come [???] they asked: wilt thou 
go with this man? she said: i will go.
 
24:59. So they sent her away [???] and her nurse [???] and [???]'s servant [???] and 
his company.
 
24:60. Wishing prosperity to their sister [???] and saying: thou art our 
sister [???] mayst thou increase to thousands of thousands; and may thy seed 
possess the gates of their enemies.
 
24:61. So [???] and her maids [???] being set upon [???] [???] followed the 
man: who with speed returned to his master.
 
24:62. At the same time [???] [???] was walking along the way to the well 
which is called of the living and the seeing: for he [???] in the south 
country:
 
24:63. And he was gone forth to [???] in the field [???] the day being now

24:65. And said to the servant: who is that man who [???] towards us 
along the field? and he said to her: that man is my master. But she 
quickly took her cloak [???] and covered herself.
 
24:66. And the servant told [???] all that he had done.

[???] the lord.
 
25:23. And he answering [???] said: two [???] are in thy womb [???] and two 
[???] shall be divided out of thy womb [???] and one people shall overcome 
the other [???] and the elder shall serve the younger.
 
25:24. And when her time was come to be delivered [???] behold [???] were 
found in her womb.
 
25:25. He that came forth first was red [???] and [???] like a skin: and his 
name was called [???]. Immediately the other coming forth [???] held his 
brother's foot in his hand: and therefore he was called [???].
 
25:26. [???] was [???] years old when the children were born unto 
him.
 
25:27. And when they were grown up [???] [???] became a [???] hunter [???] and a 
[???]: but [???] [???] a plain man [???] [???] in tents.
 
25:28. [???] loved [???] [???] because he ate of his hunting: and [???] 
loved [???].
 
25:29. And [???] [???] [???]: to whom [???] [???] coming faint out of the 
field [???] 
 
25:30. Said: give me of this red [???] [???] for i am exceeding faint. For 
which reason his name was called [???].
 
25:31. And [???] said to him: sell me thy first [???].
 
25:32. He answered: lo i die [???] what will the first [???] [???] me?
 
25:33. [???] said: swear therefore to me. [???] swore to him [???] and sold 
his first [???].
 
25:34. And so taking bread and the [???] of [???] [???] he ate [???] and 
drank [???] and went on his way; making little account of having sold his 
first [???].
 
[???] chapter 26
 
[???] [???] in [???] [???] where god [???] to him the promise made 
to [???]. King [???] [???] league with him.
 
26:1. And when a [???] came in the land [???] after that [???] which 
had happened in the days of [???] [???] [???] went to [???] [???] king of 
the [???] [???] to [???].
 
26:2. And the lord appeared to him [???] and said: go not down into egypt [???] 
but stay in the land that i shall tell thee.
 
26:3. And [???] in it [???] and i will be with thee [???] and will bless thee:
for to thee and to thy seed i will give all these countries [???] to [???] 
the oath which i swore to [???] thy father.
 
26:4. And i will [???] thy seed like the stars of heaven: and i will 
give to thy posterity all these countries: and in thy seed shall all the 
[???] of the earth be blessed.
 
26:5. Because [???] [???] my voice [???] and kept my [???] and 
[???] [???] and observed my [???] and laws.
 
26:6. So [???] [???] in [???].
 
26:7. And when he was asked by the men of that place [???] concerning his 
wife [???] he answered: she is my sister: for he was afraid to confess that 
she was his wife [???] thinking lest perhaps they would kill him because of 
her beauty.
 
26:8. And when very many days were passed [???] and he [???] there [???] 
[???] [???] king of the [???] [???] looking out through a window [???] saw him 
playing with [???] [???] his wife.
 
26:9. And calling for him [???] he said: it is evident she is thy wife: why 
didst thou feign her to be thy sister? he answered: i feared lest i 
should die for her sake.
 
26:10. And [???] said: why hast thou deceived us? some man of the 
people might have [???] with thy wife [???] and thou hadst brought upon us a 
great sin. And he commanded all the people [???] saying:
 
26:11. He that shall touch this man's wife [???] shall surely be put to 
death.
 
26:12. And [???] [???] in that land [???] and he found that same year a 
[???]: and the lord blessed him.
 
26:13. And the man was [???] [???] and he went on [???] and 
increasing [???] till he became exceeding great.
 
26:14. And he had [???] of sheep and of [???] [???] and a very great 
family. Wherefore the [???] [???] him [???] 
 
26:15. Stopped up at that time all the [???] [???] that the servants of his 
father [???] [???] [???] had [???] [???] filling them up with earth:
 
26:16. [???] that [???] himself said to [???]: depart from us [???] 
for thou art become much [???] than we.
 
26:17. So he departed [???] and came to the [???] of [???] [???] to dwell 
there:
 
26:18. And he [???] again other [???] [???] which the servants of his 
father [???] [???] [???] had [???] [???] and which [???] after his death [???] the [???] 
had of old stopped up: and he called them by the same names [???] by which 
his father before had called them.
 
26:19. And they [???] in the [???] [???] and found living water:
 
[???]... That is [???] a channel where sometimes a [???] or violent 
stream had run.
 
26:20. But there also the [???] of [???] [???] against the [???] 
of [???] [???] saying: it is our water. Wherefore he called the name of the 
well [???] on occasion of that which had happened [???] [???].
 
26:21. And they [???] also another; and for that they [???] 
likewise [???] and he called the name of it [???] enmity.
 
26:22. Going forward from thence [???] he [???] another well [???] for which they 
[???] not; therefore he called the name thereof [???] [???] [???] saying:
now hath the lord given us room [???] and made us to increase upon the earth.
 
[???]... That is [???] [???] [???] or room.
 
26:23. And he went up from that place to [???] [???] 
 
26:24. Where the lord appeared to him that same night [???] saying: i am the 
god of [???] thy father [???] do not fear [???] for i am with thee: i will bless 
thee [???] and [???] thy seed for my servant [???]'s sake.
 
26:25. And he built there an altar: and called upon the name of the 
lord [???] and [???] his tent; and commanded his servants to dig a well.
 
26:26. To which place when [???] [???] and [???] his friend [???] and 
[???] chief captain of his soldiers [???] came from [???] [???] 
 
26:27. [???] said to them: why are ye come to me [???] a man whom you hate [???] 
and have thrust out from you?
 
26:28. And they answered: we saw that the lord is with thee [???] and 
therefore we said: let there be an oath between us [???] and let us make a 
[???] [???] 
 
26:29. That thou do us no harm [???] as we on our part have touched nothing 
of thine [???] nor have done any thing to hurt thee; but with peace have sent 
thee away [???] [???] with the blessing of the lord.
 
26:30. And he made them a feast [???] and after they had eaten and drunk:
 
26:31. [???] in the morning [???] they swore one to another: and [???] sent 
them away [???] to their own home.
 
26:32. And behold [???] the same day the servants of [???] came [???] telling him 
of a well which they had [???] [???] and saying: we have found water.
 
26:33. Whereupon he called it abundance: and the name of the city was 
called [???] [???] even to this day.
 
26:34. And [???] being forty years old [???] married wives [???] [???] [???] the 
daughter of [???] [???] the [???] [???] and [???] [???] the daughter of [???] [???] of 
the same place.
 
26:35. And they both offended the mind of [???] and [???].
 
[???] chapter 27
 
[???] [???] by him mother's counsel [???] [???] his father's blessing instead 
of [???]. And by her is advised to fly to his uncle [???].
 
27:1. Now [???] was old [???] and his eyes were dim [???] and he could not see:
and he called [???] [???] his elder son [???] and said to him: my son? and he 
answered: here i am.
 
27:2. And his father said to him [???] thou seest that i am old [???] and know not 
the day of my death.
 
27:3. Take thy arms [???] thy [???] [???] and bow [???] and go abroad; and when thou 
hast taken something by hunting [???] 
 
27:4. Make me a [???] meat thereof [???] as thou knowest i like [???] and bring 
it that i may eat: and my soul may bless thee [???] before i die.
 
27:5. And when [???] had heard this [???] and he was gone into the field to 
[???] his father's commandment [???] 
 
27:6. She said to her son [???]: i heard thy father talking with [???] [???] 
thy brother [???] and saying to him:
 
27:7. Bring me of thy hunting [???] and make me [???] that i may eat [???] and 
bless thee in the sight of the lord [???] before i die.
 
27:8. Now therefore [???] my son [???] follow my counsel:
 
27:9. And go thy way to the flock [???] bring me two [???] of the best [???] that i 
may make of them meat for thy father [???] such as he gladly [???].
 
27:10. Which when thou hast brought in [???] and he hath eaten [???] he may bless 
thee before he die.
 
27:11. And he answered her: thou knowest that [???] [???] my brother [???] is a 
[???] man [???] and i am smooth:
 
27:12. If my father should feel me [???] and perceive it [???] i fear lest he will 
think i would have [???] him [???] and i shall bring upon me a curse instead 
of a blessing.
 
27:13. And his mother said to him: upon me be this curse [???] my son: only 
hear thou my voice [???] and go [???] fetch me the things which i have said.
 
27:14. He went [???] and brought [???] and gave them to his mother. She dressed 
[???] [???] such as she knew his father liked.
 
27:15. And she put on him very good garments of [???] [???] which she had at 
home with her:
 
27:16. And the little [???] of the [???] she put about his hands [???] and 
covered the bare of his neck.
 
27:17. And she gave him the [???] meat [???] and delivered him bread that 
she had [???].
 
27:18. Which when he had carried in [???] he said: my father? but he 
answered: i hear. Who art thou [???] my son?
 
27:19. And [???] said: i am [???] [???] thy [???]: i have done as thou 
didst command me: arise [???] sit and eat of my [???] [???] that thy soul may 
bless me.
 
i am [???] thy [???]... St. [???] (L. [???] [???] [???] C. 10) [???] 
[???] at large upon this place [???] [???] [???] from a lie [???] because 
this whole passage was mysterious [???] as [???] to the [???] which 
was afterwards to be given to the [???] before the [???] [???] [???] which 
[???] by [???] light might understand. So far is certain [???] that the 
first [???] [???] both by divine election and by [???]'s free [???] 
[???] to [???]: so that if there were any lie in the case [???] it could 
be no more than an [???] and [???] one.
 
27:20. And [???] said to his son: how couldst thou find it so quickly [???] 
my son? he answered: it was the will of god [???] that what i sought came 
quickly in my way:
 
27:21. And [???] said: come hither [???] that i may feel thee [???] my son [???] and 
may prove whether thou be my son [???] [???] or no.
 
27:22. He came near to his father [???] and when he had felt him [???] [???] said:
the voice indeed is the voice of [???]; but the hands [???] are the hands of 
[???].
 
27:23. And he knew him not [???] because his [???] hands made him like to the 
elder. Then blessing him [???] 
 
27:24. He said: art thou my son [???]? he answered: i am.
 
27:25. Then he said: bring me the [???] of thy hunting [???] my son [???] that my 
soul may bless thee. And when they were brought [???] and he had eaten [???] he 
offered him wine also [???] which after he had drunk [???] 
 
27:26. He said to him: come near me [???] and give me a kiss [???] my son.
 
27:27. He came near [???] and [???] him. And immediately as he [???] the 
[???] smell of his garments [???] blessing him [???] he said: behold [???] the smell 
of my son is as the smell of a [???] field [???] which the lord hath 
blessed.
 
27:28. God give thee of the dew of heaven [???] and of the [???] of the 
earth [???] abundance of corn and wine.
 
27:29. And let [???] serve thee [???] and [???] worship thee: be thou lord 
of thy brethren [???] and let thy mother's children bow down before thee.
cursed be he that [???] thee: and let him that [???] thee be filled 
with blessings.
 
27:30. [???] had scarce ended his words [???] when [???] [???] being now gone out 
abroad [???] [???] came [???] 
 
27:31. And brought in to his father [???] [???] made of what he had taken in 
hunting [???] saying: arise [???] my father [???] and eat of thy son's [???]; that 
thy soul may bless me.
 
27:32. And [???] said to him: why! who art thou? he answered: i am thy 
[???] son [???] [???].
 
27:33. [???] was struck with fear [???] and [???] exceedingly; and 
wondering beyond what can be believed [???] said: who is he then that even 
now brought me [???] that he had taken [???] and i ate of all before thou 
[???]? and i have blessed him [???] and he shall be blessed.
 
27:34. [???] having heard his father's words [???] [???] out with a great 
cry; and [???] being in a [???] [???] said: bless me also [???] my father.
 
27:35. And he said: thy brother came [???] and got thy blessing.
 
27:36. But he said again: rightly is his name called [???]; for he hath 
[???] me lo this second time: my [???] he took away before [???] 
and now this second time he hath stolen away my blessing. And again he 
said to his father: hast thou not reserved me also a blessing?
 
[???]... That is [???] a [???].
 
27:37. [???] answered: i have appointed him thy lord [???] and have made all 
his brethren his servants: i have established him with corn and wine [???] 
and after this [???] what shall i do more for thee [???] my son?
 
27:38. And [???] said to him: hast thou only one blessing [???] father? i 
beseech thee bless me also. And when he wept with a loud cry [???] 
 
27:39. [???] being moved [???] said to him: in the fat of the earth [???] and in 
the dew of heaven from above [???] 
 
27:40. Shall thy blessing be. Thou shalt live by the sword [???] and shalt 
serve thy brother: and the time shall come [???] when thou shalt shake off 
and loose his yoke from thy neck.
 
27:41. [???] therefore always hated [???] [???] for the blessing wherewith his 
father had blessed him; and he said in his heart: the days will come of 
the mourning for my father [???] and i will kill my brother [???].
 
27:42. These things were told to [???]: and she sent and called [???] [???] 
her son [???] and said to him: behold [???] [???] thy brother [???] [???] to kill 
thee.
 
27:43. Now therefore [???] my son [???] hear my voice [???] arise and [???] to [???] [???] my 
brother [???] to [???]:
 
27:44. And thou shalt dwell with him a few days [???] till the wrath of thy 
brother be [???] [???] 
 
27:45. And his indignation cease [???] and he forget the things thou hast 
done to him: afterwards i will send [???] and bring thee from thence hither.
why shall i be [???] of both my sons in one day?
 
27:46. And [???] said to [???]: i am weary of my life [???] because of the 
daughters of [???]: if [???] take a wife of the stock of this land [???] i 
choose not to live.
 
[???] chapter 28
 
[???]'s journey to [???]: his vision and vow.
 
28:1. And [???] called [???] [???] and blessed him [???] and charged him [???] saying:
take not a wife of the stock of [???]:
 
28:2. But go [???] and take a journey to [???] of [???] [???] to the house 
of [???] [???] thy mother's father [???] and take thee a wife thence of the 
daughters of [???] [???] thy uncle.
 
28:3. And god [???] bless thee [???] and make thee to increase and 
[???] thee: that thou mayst be a multitude of people.
 
28:4. And give the blessings of [???] to thee [???] and to thy seed after 
thee: that thou mayst possess the land of thy [???] [???] which he 
promised to thy grandfather.
 
28:5. And when [???] had sent him away [???] he took his journey and went to 
[???] of [???] [???] to [???] [???] the son of [???] [???] the [???] [???] brother 
to [???] [???] his mother.
 
28:6. And [???] seeing that his father had blessed [???] [???] and had sent 
him into [???] of [???] [???] to marry a wife thence; and that after 
the blessing he had charged him [???] saying: thou shalt not take a wife of 
the daughters of [???]:
 
28:7. And that [???] [???] his parents [???] was gone into [???]:
 
28:8. [???] also [???] that his father was not well pleased with the 
daughters of [???]:
 
28:9. He went to [???] [???] and took to wife [???] besides them he had before [???] 
[???] [???] the daughter of [???] [???] [???]'s son [???] the sister of [???].
 
28:10. But [???] being departed from [???] [???] went on to [???].
 
28:11. And when he was come to a certain place [???] and would rest in it 
after [???] [???] he took of the stones that lay there [???] and putting under 
his head [???] slept in the same place.
 
28:12. And he saw in his sleep a ladder standing upon the earth [???] and the 
top thereof touching heaven: the angels also of god [???] and 
[???] by it.
 
28:13. And the lord leaning upon the ladder saying to him: i am the lord 
god of [???] thy father [???] and the god of [???]: the land [???] wherein thou 
[???] [???] i will give to thee and to thy seed.
 
28:14. And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth: thou shalt spread 
abroad to the west [???] and to the east [???] and to the north [???] and to the south:
and in thee and thy seed [???] all the [???] of the earth shall be blessed.
 
28:15. And i will be thy keeper [???] thou goest [???] and will bring 
thee back into this land: neither will i leave thee [???] till i shall have 
[???] all that i have said.
 
28:16. And when [???] [???] out of sleep [???] he said: indeed the lord is 
in this place [???] and i knew it not.
 
28:17. And trembling [???] he said: how terrible is this place? this is no 
other but the house of god [???] and the gate of heaven.
 
28:18. And [???] [???] in the morning [???] took the stone which he had 
laid under his head [???] and set it up for a title [???] [???] oil upon the top 
of it.
 
28:19. And he called the name of the city [???] [???] which before was 
called [???].
 
[???]... This name [???] the house of god.
 
28:20. And he made a vow [???] saying: if god shall be with me [???] and shall 
keep me in the way [???] by which i walk [???] and shall give me bread to eat [???] and 
[???] to put on [???] 
 
28:21. And i shall return [???] to my father's house: the lord 
shall be my god:
 
28:22. And this stone [???] which i have set up for a title [???] shall be called 
the house of god: and of all things that thou shalt give to me [???] i will 
offer [???] to thee.
 
[???] chapter 29
 
[???] [???] [???] seven years for [???]: but is deceived with [???]: he 
afterwards [???] [???]. [???] bears him four sons.
 
29:1. Then [???] went on in his journey [???] and came into the east country.
 
29:2. And he saw a well in the field [???] and three [???] of sheep lying by 
it: for the beasts were [???] out of it [???] and the mouth thereof was 
closed with a great stone.
 
29:3. And the custom was [???] when all the sheep were [???] together [???] to 
roll away the stone [???] and after the sheep were [???] [???] to put it on the 
mouth of the well again.
 
29:4. And he said to the [???]: brethren [???] whence are you? they 
answered: of [???].
 
29:5. And he asked them [???] saying: know you [???] [???] the son of [???]? they 
said: we know him.
 
29:6. He said: is he in health? he is in health [???] say they: and behold [???] 
[???] [???] his daughter [???] [???] with his flock.
 
29:7. And [???] said: there is yet much day remaining [???] neither is it 
time to bring the [???] into the [???] again: first give the sheep 
drink [???] and so lead them back to feed.
 
29:8. They answered: we cannot [???] till all the cattle be [???] 
together [???] and we remove the stone from the well's mouth [???] that we may 
water the [???].
 
29:9. They were yet speaking [???] and behold [???] came with her father's 
sheep; for she fed the flock.
 
29:10. And when [???] saw her [???] and knew her to be his cousin german [???] and 
that they were the sheep of [???] [???] his uncle: he removed the stone 
wherewith the well was closed.
 
29:11. And having [???] the flock [???] he [???] her: and [???] up his 
voice wept.
 
29:12. And he told her that he was her father's brother [???] and the son of 
[???]: but she went in haste and told her father.
 
29:13. Who [???] when he heard that [???] his sister's son was come [???] ran 
forth to meet him: and [???] him [???] and heartily kissing him [???] brought 
him into his house. And when he had heard the causes of his journey [???] 
 
29:14. He answered: thou art my bone and my flesh. And after the days of 
one month were [???] [???] 
 
29:15. He said to him: because thou art my brother [???] shalt thou serve me 
without wages? tell me what wages thou wilt have.
 
29:16. Now he had two daughters [???] the name of the elder was [???]; and the 
younger was called [???].
 
29:17. But [???] was [???]-eyed: [???] was well favoured [???] and of a 
beautiful countenance.
 
29:18. And [???] being in love with her [???] said: i will serve thee seven 
years for [???] [???] thy younger daughter.
 
29:19. [???] answered: it is better that i give her to thee than to 
another man; stay with me.
 
29:20. So [???] served seven years for [???]: and they seemed but a few 
days [???] because of the greatness of his love.
 
29:21. And he said to [???]: give me my wife; for now the time is 
[???] [???] that i may go in unto her.
 
29:22. And he [???] having invited a great number of his friends to the 
feast [???] made the marriage.
 
29:23. And at night he brought in [???] [???] his daughter [???] to him [???] 
 
29:24. Giving his daughter a [???] [???] named [???]. Now when [???] had 
gone in to her according to custom [???] when morning was come he saw it was 
[???].
 
29:25. And he said to his father-in-law: what is it that thou didst mean 
to do? did not i serve thee for [???]? why hast thou deceived me?
 
29:26. [???] answered: it is not the custom in this place [???] to give the 
younger in marriage first.
 
29:27. Make up the week of days of this match: and i will give thee her 
also [???] for the service that thou shalt render me other seven years.
 
29:28. He yielded to his pleasure: and after the week was past [???] he 
married [???]:
 
29:29. To whom her father gave [???] [???] for her servant.
 
29:30. And having at length [???] the marriage he wished for [???] he 
[???] the love of the latter before the former [???] and served with him 
other seven years.
 
29:31. And the lord seeing that he despised [???] [???] opened her womb [???] but 
her sister remained barren.
 
29:32. And she [???] and bore a son [???] and called his name [???] [???] 
saying: the lord saw my affliction: now my husband will love me.
 
29:33. And again she [???] and bore a son [???] and said: because the 
lord heard that i was despised [???] he hath given this also to me: and she 
called his name [???].
 
29:34. And she [???] the third time [???] and bore another son [???] and said:
now also my husband will be joined to me [???] because i have borne him three 
sons: and therefore she called his name [???].
 
29:35. The fourth time she [???] and bore a son [???] and said: now will 
i praise the lord: and for this she called him [???]. And she left 
bearing.
 
[???] chapter 30
 
[???] [???] being barren [???] [???] her [???] to [???]; she [???] two 
sons. [???] [???] to bear [???] [???] also her [???] [???] and she [???] two 
more. Then [???] [???] other two sons and one daughter. [???] [???] 
joseph. [???] [???] [???] to return home [???] is [???] to stay for a certain 
part of the flock's increase [???] whereby he [???] exceeding rich.
 
30:1. And [???] seeing herself without children [???] [???] her sister [???] and 
said to her husband: give me children [???] otherwise i shall die.
 
30:2. And [???] being angry with her [???] answered: am i as god [???] who hath 
[???] thee of the fruit of thy womb?
 
30:3. But she said: i have here my servant [???]: go in unto her [???] that 
she may bear upon my knees [???] and i may have children by her.
 
30:4. And she gave him [???] in marriage: who [???] 
 
30:5. When her husband had gone in unto her [???] [???] and bore a son.
 
30:6. And [???] said: the lord hath judged for me [???] and hath heard my 
voice [???] giving me a son; and therefore she called his name [???].
 
30:7. And again [???] [???] [???] and bore another [???] 
 
30:8. For whom [???] said: god hath [???] me with my sister [???] and i 
have [???]: and she called him [???].
 
30:9. [???] [???] that she had left of bearing [???] gave [???] [???] her 
[???] [???] to her husband.
 
30:10. And when she had [???] [???] and brought forth a son [???] 
 
30:11. She said: happily. And therefore called his name gad.
 
30:12. [???] also bore another.
 
30:13. And [???] said: this is for my happiness: for women will call me 
blessed. Therefore she called him [???].
 
30:14. And [???] going out in the time of the wheat harvest into the 
field [???] found [???]: which he brought to his mother [???]. And [???] 
said: give me part of thy son's [???].
 
30:15. She answered: dost thou think it a small matter [???] that thou hast 
taken my husband from me [???] unless thou take also my son's [???]?
[???] said: he shall sleep with thee this night [???] for thy son's 
[???].
 
30:16. And when [???] returned at even from the field [???] [???] went out to 
meet him [???] and said: thou shalt come in unto me [???] because i have [???] 
thee for my son's [???]. And he slept with her that night.
 
30:17. And god heard her prayers; and she [???]: and bore a fifth 
son:
 
30:18. And said: god hath given me a reward [???] because i gave my [???] 
to my husband. And she called his name [???].
 
30:19. And [???] [???] again [???] and bore the sixth son [???] 
 
30:20. And said: god hath [???] me with a good dowry; this turn also 
my husband will be with me [???] because i have borne him six sons: and 
therefore she called his name [???].
 
30:21. After whom she bore a daughter [???] named [???].
 
30:22. The lord also [???] [???] [???] heard her [???] and opened her womb.
 
30:23. And she [???] [???] and bore a son [???] saying: god hath taken away my 
reproach.
 
30:24. And she called his name joseph: saying: the lord give me also 
another son.
 
30:25. And when joseph was born [???] [???] said to his father-in-law: send 
me away [???] that i may return into my country [???] and to my land.
 
30:26. Give me my wives [???] and my children [???] for whom i have served thee [???] 
that i may depart: thou knowest the service that i have [???] thee.
 
30:27. [???] said to him: let me find favour in thy sight: i have 
learned [???] by experience [???] that god hath blessed me for thy sake.
 
30:28. Appoint thy wages which i shall give thee.
 
30:29. But he answered: thou knowest how i have served thee [???] and how 
great thy possession hath been in my hands.
 
30:30. Thou hadst but little before i came to thee [???] and now thou art 
become rich: and the lord hath blessed thee at my coming. It is 
reasonable [???] therefore [???] that i should now provide also for my own house.
 
30:31. And [???] said: what shall i give thee? but he said: i require 
nothing; but if thou wilt do what i demand [???] i will feed and keep thy 
sheep again.
 
30:32. Go round through all thy [???] [???] and separate all the sheep of 
divers colours [???] and [???]; and all that is brown and spotted [???] and of 
divers colours [???] as well among the sheep as among the [???] [???] shall be my 
wages.
 
30:33. And my justice shall answer for me tomorrow before thee [???] when the 
time of the bargain shall come; and all that is not of divers colours [???] 
and spotted [???] and brown [???] as well among the sheep as among the [???] [???] 
shall accuse me of theft.
 
30:34. And [???] said: i like well what thou [???].
 
30:35. And he [???] the same day the she-[???] [???] and the sheep [???] and 
the he-[???] [???] and the [???] of divers colours [???] and spotted; and all the 
flock of one colour [???] that is [???] of white and black [???] [???] he delivered 
into the hands of his sons.
 
30:36. And he set the space of three days journey betwixt himself and 
his son-in-law [???] who fed the rest of his flock.
 
30:37. And [???] took green [???] of [???] [???] and of [???] [???] and of [???]-
trees [???] and [???] them in part: so when the bark was taken off [???] in the 
parts that were [???] [???] there appeared [???]: but the parts that 
were whole [???] remained green: and by this means the colour was divers.
 
30:38. And he put them in the [???] [???] where the water was [???] out;
that when the [???] should come to drink [???] they might have the [???] 
before their eyes [???] and in the sight of them might conceive.
 
30:39. And it came to pass [???] that in the very heat of [???] [???] the sheep 
beheld the [???] [???] and brought forth spotted [???] and of divers colours [???] and 
[???].
 
30:40. And [???] [???] the flock [???] and put the [???] in the [???] 
before the eyes of the [???]; and all the white and the black were 
[???]'s [???] and the rest were [???]'s [???] when the [???] were [???] one 
from the other.
 
30:41. So when the [???] went first to ram [???] [???] put the [???] in the 
[???] of water before the eyes of the [???] [???] and of the [???] [???] that they 
might conceive while they were looking upon them.
 
30:42. But when the later coming was [???] and the last [???] [???] he did 
not put them. And those that were [???] [???] became [???]'s; and they of 
the first time [???] [???]'S.
 
30:43. And the man was [???] exceedingly [???] and he had many [???] [???] 
maid-servants and men-servants [???] [???] and [???].
 
[???] chapter 31
 
[???]'s departure: he is pursued and [???] by [???]. They make a 
[???].
 
31:1. But after that he had heard the words of the sons of [???] [???] 
saying: [???] hath taken away all that was our father's [???] and being 
[???] by his substance is become great.
 
31:2. And [???] also [???] that [???]'s countenance was not towards him 
as yesterday and the other day.
 
31:3. Especially the lord saying to him: return into the land of thy 
fathers and to thy kindred [???] and i will be with thee.
 
31:4. He sent [???] and called [???] and [???] into the field [???] where he fed 
the [???] [???] 
 
31:5. And said to them: i see your father's countenance is not towards 
me as yesterday and the other day: but the god of my father hath been 
with me.
 
31:6. And you know that i have served your father to the [???] of my 
power.
 
31:7. Yea your father hath also [???] me [???] and hath changed my 
wages ten times: and yet god hath not suffered him to hurt me.
 
31:8. If at any time [???] he said: the [???] shall be thy wages: all the 
sheep brought forth [???]: but when he said on the contrary: thou 
shalt take all the white one for thy wages: all the [???] brought forth 
white ones.
 
31:9. And god hath taken your father's substance [???] and given it to me.
 
31:10. For after the time came of the [???] [???] [???] i lifted up my 
eyes [???] and saw in my sleep [???] that the [???] which [???] upon the [???] 
were of divers colours [???] and spotted [???] and [???].
 
31:11. And the angel of god said to me in my sleep: [???]. And i 
answered: here i am.
 
31:12. And he said: lift up thy eyes [???] and see that all the [???] [???] 
upon the [???] [???] are of divers colours [???] spotted and [???]. For i 
have seen all that [???] hath done to thee.
 
31:13. I am the god of [???] [???] where thou didst [???] the stone [???] and 
make a vow to me. Now therefore arise [???] and go out of this land [???] and 
return into thy native country.
 
31:14. And [???] and [???] answered: have we any thing left among the 
goods and inheritance of our father's house?
 
31:15. Hath he not [???] us as strangers [???] and sold us [???] and eaten up 
the price of us?
 
31:16. But god hath taken our father's riches [???] and delivered them to us [???] 
and to our children: wherefore [???] do all that god hath commanded thee.
 
31:17. Then [???] rose up [???] and having set his children and wives upon 
[???] [???] went his way.
 
31:18. And he took all his substance [???] and [???] [???] and whatsoever he had 
[???] in [???] [???] and went forward to [???] [???] his father [???] to the 
land of [???].
 
31:19. At that time [???] was gone to [???] his sheep [???] and [???] stole 
away her father's [???].
 
her father's [???]... By this it appears that [???] was an [???]; and 
some of the fathers are of opinion that [???] stole away these [???] to 
withdraw him from [???] [???] [???] the occasion of his sin.
 
31:20. And [???] would not confess to his father-in-law that he was 
flying away.
 
31:21. And when he was gone [???] together with all that [???] to him [???] and 
having passed the river [???] was going on towards mount [???] [???] 
 
31:22. It was told [???] on the third day [???] that [???] fled.
 
31:23. And he took his brethren with him [???] and pursued after him seven 
days; and [???] him in the mount of [???].
 
31:24. And he saw in a dream god [???] saying to him: take heed thou speak 
not any thing [???] against [???].
 
31:25. Now [???] had [???] his tent in the mountain: and when he [???] with 
his brethren [???] had [???] him [???] he [???] his tent in the same mount 
of [???].
 
31:26. And he said to [???]: why hast thou done thus [???] to carry away [???] 
without my knowledge [???] my daughters as [???] taken with the sword?
 
31:27. Why wouldst thou run away [???] [???] and not acquaint me [???] that i 
might have brought thee on the way with joy [???] and with songs [???] and with 
[???] [???] and with [???]?
 
31:28. Thou hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and daughters; thou 
hast done [???]; and now indeed [???] 
 
31:29. It is in my power to return thee evil; but the god of your father 
said to me yesterday: take heed thou speak not any thing [???] against 
[???].
 
31:30. Suppose thou didst desire to go to thy friends [???] and hadst a 
longing after thy father's house: why hast thou stolen away my gods?
 
31:31. [???] answered: that i departed unknown to thee [???] it was for fear 
lest thou wouldst take away thy daughters by force.
 
31:32. But [???] whereas [???] thou [???] me with theft: with [???] thou 
shalt find thy gods [???] let him be slain before our brethren. Search [???] and 
if thou find any of thy things with me [???] take them away. Now when he said 
this [???] he knew not that [???] had stolen the [???].
 
31:33. So [???] went into the tent of [???] [???] and of [???] [???] and of both the 
[???] [???] and found them not. And when he was entered into [???]'s 
tent [???] 
 
31:34. She [???] in haste [???] hid the [???] under the [???]'s furniture [???] and sat 
upon them: and when he had [???] all the tent [???] and found nothing [???] 
 
31:35. She said: let not my lord be angry that i cannot rise up before 
thee [???] because it has now happened to me according to the custom of 
women. So his careful search was in vain.
 
31:36. And [???] being angry [???] said in a chiding manner: for what fault 
of mine [???] and for what offence on my part hast thou so [???] pursued me [???] 
 
31:37. And [???] all my household stuff? what hast thou found of all 
the substance of thy house? lay it here before my brethren [???] and thy 
brethren [???] and let them judge between me and thee.
 
31:38. Have i [???] therefore [???] been with thee twenty years? thy [???] and 
[???] were not barren [???] the [???] of thy [???] i did not eat:
 
31:39. Neither did i [???] thee that which the beast had torn; i made 
good all the [???]: whatsoever was lost by theft [???] thou didst exact it 
of me:
 
31:40. Day and night was i [???] with heat [???] and with frost [???] and sleep 
departed from my eyes.
 
31:41. And in this manner have i served thee in thy house twenty years [???] 
fourteen for thy daughters [???] and six for thy [???]: thou hast changed 
also my wages ten times.
 
31:42. Unless the god of my father [???] [???] [???] and the fear of [???] [???] had 
stood by me [???] peradventure now thou hadst sent me away naked: god beheld 
my affliction and the labour of my hands [???] and [???] thee yesterday.
 
31:43. [???] answered him: the daughters are mine [???] and the children [???] and 
thy [???] [???] and all things that thou seest are mine: what can i do to my 
children [???] and [???]?
 
31:44. Come [???] therefore [???] let us enter into a league; that it may be for a 
testimony between me and thee.
 
31:45. And [???] took a stone [???] and set it up for a title.
 
31:46. And he said to his brethren: bring hither stones. And they [???] 
[???] stones together [???] made a heap [???] and they ate upon it.
 
31:47. And [???] called it [???] the witness heap; and [???] [???] the [???] of 
testimony: each of them according to the [???] of his language.
 
31:48. And [???] said: this heap shall be a witness between me and thee 
this day [???] and therefore the name thereof was called [???] [???] that is [???] the 
witness heap.
 
31:49. The lord behold and judge between us [???] when we shall be gone one 
from the other.
 
31:50. If thou afflict my daughters [???] and if thou bring in other wives 
over them: none is witness of our speech but god [???] who is present and 
[???].
 
31:51. And he said again to [???]: behold this heap [???] and the stone which 
i have set up between me and thee [???] 
 
31:52. Shall be a witness: this heap [???] i say [???] and the stone [???] be they for 
a testimony [???] if either i shall pass beyond it going towards thee [???] or 
thou shalt pass beyond it thinking harm to me.
 
31:53. The god of [???] [???] and the god of [???] [???] the god of their 
father [???] judge between us. And [???] swore by the fear of his father 
[???]:
 
31:54. And after he had offered [???] in the mountain [???] he called 
his brethren to eat bread. And when they had eaten [???] they [???] there:
 
31:55. But [???] arose in the night [???] and [???] his sons and daughters [???] 
and blessed them: and returned to his place.
 
[???] chapter 32
 
[???]'s vision of angels; his message and presents to [???]; his 
[???] with an angel.
 
32:1. [???] also went on the journey he had begun: and the angels of god 
met him.
 
32:2. And when he saw them [???] he said: these are the camps of god [???] and he 
called the name of that place [???] [???] that is [???] camps.
 
32:3. And he sent messengers before him to [???] [???] his brother [???] to the 
land of [???] [???] to the country of [???]:
 
32:4. And he commanded them [???] saying: thus shall ye speak to my lord 
[???]: thus [???] thy brother [???]: i have [???] with [???] [???] and 
have been with him until this day:
 
32:5. I have [???] [???] and [???] [???] and sheep [???] and men-servants [???] and 
women-servants: and now i send a message to my lord [???] that i may find 
favour in thy sight.
 
32:6. And the messengers returned to [???] [???] saying: we came to [???] [???] thy 
brother [???] and behold he [???] with speed to meet thee with four hundred 
men.
 
32:7. Then [???] was greatly afraid; and in his fear divided the people 
that was with him [???] and the [???] [???] and the sheep [???] and the [???] [???] and the 
[???] [???] into two [???] [???] 
 
32:8. Saying: if [???] come to one company [???] and destroy it [???] the other 
company that is left [???] shall escape.
 
32:9. And [???] said: o god of my father [???] [???] and god of my father 
[???]: o lord who [???] to me [???] return to thy land [???] and to the place of 
thy birth [???] and i will do well for thee.
 
32:10. I am not worthy of the least of all thy [???] [???] and of thy truth 
which thou hast [???] to thy servant. With my staff i passed over 
this [???]; and now i return with two [???].
 
32:11. Deliver me from the hand of my brother [???] [???] for i am greatly 
afraid of him; lest perhaps he come [???] and kill the mother with the 
children.
 
32:12. Thou didst say [???] that thou wouldst do well by me [???] and [???] my 
seed like the sand of the sea [???] which cannot be [???] for multitude.
 
32:13. And when he had slept there that night [???] he set apart [???] of the 
things which he had [???] presents for his brother [???] [???] 
 
32:14. Two hundred she-[???] [???] twenty he-[???] [???] two hundred [???] [???] and 
twenty [???] [???] 
 
32:15. Thirty [???] [???] with their [???] [???] forty [???] [???] and twenty 
[???] [???] twenty she-[???] [???] and ten of their [???].
 
32:16. And he sent them by the hands of his servants [???] every drove by 
itself [???] and he said to his servants: go before me [???] and let there be a 
space between drove and drove.
 
32:17. And he commanded the first [???] saying: if thou meet my brother [???] [???] 
and he ask thee: whose art thou? or whither goest thou? or whose are 
these before thee?
 
32:18. Thou shalt answer: thy servant [???]'s: he hath sent them as a 
present to my lord [???]; and he [???] after us.
 
32:19. In like manner he commanded the second [???] and the third [???] and all 
that followed the [???] [???] saying: speak ye the same words to [???] [???] when 
ye find him.
 
32:20. And ye shall add: thy servant [???] himself also [???] after 
us; for he said: i will [???] him with the presents that go before [???] 
and afterwards i will see him [???] perhaps he will be gracious to me.
 
32:21. So the presents went before him [???] but himself [???] that night in 
the camp.
 
32:22. And rising early [???] he took his two wives and his two [???] [???] 
with his eleven sons [???] and passed over the ford of [???].
 
32:23. And when all things were brought over that [???] to him [???] 
 
32:24. He remained alone; and behold [???] a man [???] with him till 
morning.
 
a man [???] etc... This was an angel in human shape [???] as we learn from [???] 
12. 4. He is called god [???] ver. 28 and 30 [???] because he [???] the 
person of the son of god. This [???] [???] in which [???] [???] [???] by 
god [???] was a match for an angel [???] was so ordered (ver. 28 [???]) that he might 
learn by this [???] of the divine assistance [???] that neither [???] [???] 
nor any other man [???] should have power to hurt him.-it was also [???] [???] 
as [???] by his earnest prayer [???] [???] and at last [???] the 
angel's blessing.
 
32:25. And when he saw that he could not overcome him [???] he touched the 
[???] of his thigh [???] and forthwith it [???].
 
32:26. And he said to him: let me go [???] for it is break of day. He 
answered: i will not let thee go [???] except thou bless me.
 
32:27. And he said: what is thy name? he answered: [???].
 
32:28. But he said: thy name shall not be called [???] [???] but [???]; for 
if thou hast been strong against god [???] how much more shalt thou prevail 
against men?
 
32:29. [???] asked him: tell me by what name art thou called? he 
answered: why dost thou ask my name? and he blessed him in the same 
place.
 
32:30. And [???] called the name of the place [???] [???] saying: i have 
seen god face to face [???] and my soul has been saved.
 
[???]... This word [???] the face of god [???] or the sight [???] or seeing 
of god.
 
32:31. And immediately the sun rose upon him [???] after he was past [???];
but he [???] on his foot.
 
32:32. Therefore the children of [???] [???] unto this day [???] eat not the 
[???] [???] that [???] in [???]'s thigh: because he touched the [???] of his 
thigh and it [???].
 
[???] chapter 33
 
[???] and [???] meet: [???] [???] to [???] [???] where he [???] an altar.
 
33:1. And [???] [???] up his eyes [???] saw [???] coming [???] and with him four 
hundred men: and he divided the children of [???] and of [???] [???] and of 
the two [???].
 
33:2. And he put both the [???] and their children [???]: and [???] 
and her children in the second place: and [???] and joseph last.
 
33:3. And he went forward and [???] down with his face to the ground 
seven times [???] until his brother came near.
 
33:4. Then [???] ran to meet his brother [???] and [???] him: and [???] 
him fast about the neck [???] and kissing him [???] wept.
 
33:5. And [???] up his eyes [???] he saw the women and their children [???] and 
said: what mean these? and do they belong to thee? he answered: they are 
the children which god hath given to me [???] thy servant.
 
33:6. Then the [???] and their children came near and [???] 
themselves.
 
33:7. [???] also [???] with her children [???] came near and [???] down in like 
manner; and last of all [???] joseph and [???] [???] down.
 
33:8. And [???] said: what are the [???] that i met? he answered: that i 
might find favour before my lord.
 
33:9. But he said: i have plenty [???] my brother [???] keep what is thine for 
thyself.
 
33:10. And [???] said: do not so i beseech thee [???] but if i have found 
favour in thy eyes [???] receive a little present at my hands: for i have 
seen thy face [???] as if i should have seen the countenance of god: be 
gracious to me [???] 
 
33:11. And take the blessing which i have brought thee [???] and which god 
hath given me [???] who [???] all things. He took it with much ado at his 
brother's earnest [???] him [???] 
 
33:12. And said: let us go on together [???] and i will accompany thee in thy 
journey.
 
33:13. And [???] said: my lord [???] thou knowest that i have with me tender 
children [???] and sheep [???] and [???] with young: which if i should cause to be 
[???] [???] in one day all the [???] will die.
 
33:14. May it please my lord to go before his servant: and i will follow 
softly after him [???] as i shall see my children to be able [???] until i come to 
my lord in [???].
 
33:15. [???] answered: i beseech thee [???] that some of the people [???] at least [???] 
who are with me [???] may stay to accompany thee in the way. And he said:
there is no necessity: i want nothing else but only to find favour [???] my 
lord [???] in thy sight.
 
33:16. So [???] returned that day [???] the way that he came [???] to [???].
 
33:17. And [???] came to [???]: where having built a house [???] and [???] 
tents [???] he called the name of the place [???] [???] that is [???] tents.

[???] chapter 34
 
[???] is [???] [???] for which the [???] are destroyed.
 
34:1. And [???] the daughter of [???] went out to see the women of that 
country.
 
34:2. And when [???] the son of [???] the [???] [???] the prince of that 
land [???] saw her [???] he was in love with her: and took her away [???] and lay with 
her [???] [???] the virgin.
 
34:3. And his soul was fast knit unto her; and whereas she was sad [???] he 
[???] her with sweet words.
 
34:4. And going to [???] his father [???] he said: get me this [???] to 
wife.
 
34:5. But when [???] had heard this [???] his sons being absent [???] and [???] 
in feeding the cattle [???] he held his peace till they came back.
 
34:6. And when [???] the father of [???] was come out to speak to 
[???] [???] 
 
34:7. Behold his sons came from the field: and hearing what had passed [???] 
they were exceeding angry [???] because he had done a foul thing in [???] [???] 
and committed an [???] act [???] in [???] [???]'s daughter.
 
34:8. And [???] spoke to them: the soul of my son [???] has a longing 
for your daughter: give her him to wife:
 
34:9. And let us contract [???] one with another: give us your 
daughters [???] and take you our daughters.
 
34:10. And dwell with us: the land is at your command [???] till [???] trade [???] and 
possess it.
 
34:11. [???] also said to her father and to her brethren: let me find 
favour in your sight [???] and whatsoever you shall appoint i will give:
 
34:12. Raise the dowry [???] and ask gifts [???] and i will gladly give what you 
shall demand: only give me this [???] to wife.
 
34:13. The sons of [???] answered [???] and his father [???] [???] 
being [???] at the [???] of their sister:
 
[???]... The sons of [???] [???] on this occasion [???] were guilty of a 
grievous sin [???] as well by falsely [???] religion [???] as by excess of 
revenge: though otherwise their zeal against so foul a crime was 
[???].
 
34:14. We cannot do what you demand [???] nor give our sister to one that is 
[???]; which with us is [???] and abominable.
 
34:15. But in this we may be [???] with you [???] if you will be like us [???] 
and all the male sex among you be [???]:
 
34:16. Then will we [???] give and take your daughters [???] and ours; and 
we will dwell with you [???] and will be one people:
 
34:17. But if you will not be [???] [???] we will take our daughter and 
depart.
 
34:18. Their offer pleased [???] [???] and [???] [???] his son:
 
34:19. And the young man made no delay [???] but forthwith [???] what was 
required: for he loved the [???] exceedingly [???] and he was the greatest 
man in all his father's house.
 
34:20. And going into the gate of the city [???] they spoke to the people:
 
34:21. These men are [???] [???] and are willing to dwell with us: let 
them trade in the land [???] and till it [???] which being large and wide [???] 
men to till it: we shall take their daughters for wives [???] and we will 
give them ours.
 
34:22. One thing there is for which so great a good is [???]: we must 
[???] every male among us [???] following the manner of the nation.
 
34:23. And their substance [???] and cattle [???] and all that they possess [???] shall 
be ours; only in this let us [???] [???] and by dwelling together [???] we 
shall make one people.
 
34:24. And they all agreed [???] and [???] all the [???].
 
34:25. And behold the third day [???] when the pain of the wound was 
greatest: two of the sons of [???] [???] [???] and [???] [???] the brothers of 
[???] [???] taking their swords [???] entered boldly into the city and slew all the 
men.
 
34:26. And they killed also [???] and [???] [???] and took away their sister 
[???] out of [???]'s house.
 
34:27. And when they were gone out [???] the other sons of [???] came upon 
the slain; and [???] the city in revenge of the rape.
 
34:28. And they took their sheep [???] and their [???] [???] and their [???] [???] 
[???] all they had in their houses and in their fields.
 
34:29. And their children and wives they took captive.
 
34:30. And when they had boldly [???] these things [???] [???] said to 
[???] and [???]: you have troubled me [???] and made me hateful to the 
[???] and [???] [???] the [???] of this land. We are few:
they will gather themselves together and kill me; and both i [???] and my 
house shall be destroyed.
 
34:31. They answered: should they abuse our sister as a strumpet?

pain: but his father called him [???] [???] that is [???] the son of the right 
hand.

[???] chapter 37
 
joseph's dreams: he is sold by his brethren [???] and carried into egypt.
 
37:1. And [???] [???] in the land of [???] [???] wherein his father 
[???].
 
37:2. And these are his [???]: joseph [???] when he was sixteen years 
old [???] was feeding the flock with his brethren [???] being but a boy: and he 
was with the sons of [???] and of [???] his father's wives: and he 
[???] his brethren to his father of a most wicked crime.
 
37:3. Now [???] loved joseph above all his sons [???] because he had him in 
his old age: and he made him a coat of divers colours.
 
37:4. And his brethren seeing that he was loved by his father [???] more than 
all his sons [???] hated hem [???] and could not speak [???] to him.
 
37:5. Now it fell out also that he told his brethren a dream [???] that he 
had [???]: which [???] them to hate him the more.
 
a dream... These dreams of joseph were [???] [???] and sent from god;
as were also those which he [???] [???] gen. 40. And 41.; otherwise 
generally speaking [???] the [???] of dreams is condemned in the 
[???] [???] as [???] and sinful. See [???]. 18. 10; [???]. 34. 2[???] 3.
 
37:6. And he said to them: hear my dream which i [???].
 
37:7. I thought we were [???] [???] in the field: and my [???] arose 
as it were [???] and stood [???] and your [???] standing about [???] down before 
my [???].
 
37:8. His brethren answered: shalt thou be our king? or shall we be 
subject to thy [???]? therefore this matter of his dreams and words 
[???] [???] to their envy and hatred.
 
37:9. He [???] also another dream [???] which he told his brethren [???] saying:
i saw in a dream [???] as it were the sun [???] and the moon [???] and eleven stars 
[???] me.
 
37:10. And when he had told this to his father [???] and brethren [???] his father 
[???] him and said: what [???] this dream that thou hast [???]?
shall i and thy mother [???] and thy brethren worship thee upon the earth?
 
worship... This word is not used here to signify divine worship [???] but an 
inferior [???] [???] expressed by the [???] of the body [???] and that [???] 
according to the manner of the [???] [???] [???] down to the ground.
 
37:11. His brethren therefore [???] him: but his father considered the 
thing with himself.
 
37:12. And when his brethren [???] in [???] [???] feeding their father's 
[???] [???] 
 
37:13. [???] said to him: thy brethren feed the sheep in [???]: come [???] 
i will send thee to them. And when he answered:
 
37:14. I am ready: he said to him: go [???] and see if all things be well 
with thy brethren [???] and the cattle: and bring me word again what is 
doing. So being sent from the [???] of [???] [???] he came to [???]:
 
37:15. And a man found him there wandering in the field [???] and asked what 
he sought.
 
37:16. But he answered: i seek my brethren [???] tell me where they feed the 
[???].
 
37:17. And the man said to him: they are departed from this place: for i 
heard them say: let us go to [???]. And joseph went forward after his 
brethren [???] and found them in [???].
 
37:18. And when they saw him afar off [???] before he came nigh them [???] they 
thought to kill him:
 
37:19. And said one to another: behold the [???] [???].
 
37:20. Come [???] let us kill him [???] and cast him into some old pit: and we 
will say: some evil beast hath [???] him: and then it shall appear 
what his dreams [???] him:
 
37:21. And [???] hearing this [???] [???] to deliver him out of their 
hands [???] and said:
 
37:22. Do not take away his life [???] nor shed his blood: but cast him into 
this pit [???] that is in the wilderness [???] and keep your hands harmless: now 
he said this [???] being [???] to deliver him out of their hands and to 
restore him to his father.
 
37:23. And as soon as he came to his brethren [???] they forthwith [???] him 
of his outside coat [???] that was of divers colours:
 
37:24. And cast him into an old pit where there was not water.
 
37:25. And sitting down to eat bread [???] they saw some [???] on their 
way coming from [???] [???] with their [???] [???] carrying [???] [???] and balm [???] 
and [???] to egypt.
 
37:26. And [???] said to his brethren: what will it profit us to kill our 
brother [???] and conceal his blood?
 
37:27. It is better that he be sold to the [???] [???] and that our 
hands be not [???]: for he is our brother and our flesh. His brethren 
agreed to his words.
 
37:28. And when the [???] [???] passed by [???] they drew him out of 
the pit [???] and sold him to the [???] [???] for twenty pieces of silver:
and they led him into egypt.
 
37:29. And [???] returning to the pit [???] found not the boy:
 
37:30. And [???] his garments he went to his brethren [???] and said: the 
boy doth not appear [???] and whither shall i go?
 
37:31. And they took his coat [???] and [???] it in the blood of a [???] [???] 
which they had killed:
 
37:32. Sending some to carry it to their father [???] and to say: this we 
have found: see whether it be thy son's coat [???] or not.
 
37:33. And the father [???] it [???] said: it is my son's coat [???] an 
evil wild beast hath eaten him [???] a beast hath [???] joseph.
 
37:34. And tearing his garments [???] he put on [???] [???] mourning for his 
son a long time.
 
37:35. And all his children being [???] together to comfort their 
father in his sorrow [???] he would not receive comfort [???] but said: i will go 
down to my son into hell [???] mourning. And whilst he continued weeping [???] 
 
into hell... That is [???] into [???] [???] the place where the souls of the just 
were received before the death of our [???]. For [???] that the 
word hell sometimes is taken for the grave [???] it cannot be so taken in 
this place; since [???] did not believe his son to be in the grave [???] 
(whom he supposed to be [???] by a wild beast [???]) and therefore could 
not mean to go down to him thither: but certainly meant the place of 
rest where he believed his soul to be.
 
37:36. The [???] sold joseph in egypt to [???] [???] an eunuch of 
[???] [???] captain of the soldiers.
 
an eunuch... This word sometimes [???] a chamberlain [???] courtier [???] or 
officer of the king: and so it is taken in this place.
 
[???] chapter 38
 
the sons of [???]: the death of her and [???]: the birth of [???] and 
[???].
 
38:1. At that time [???] went down from his brethren [???] and turned in to a 
certain [???] [???] named [???].
 
38:2. And he saw there the daughter of a man of [???] [???] called sue: and 
taking her to wife [???] he went in unto her.
 
38:3. And she [???] [???] and bore a son [???] and called his name her.
 
38:4. And [???] again [???] she bore a son [???] and called him [???].
 
38:5. She bore also a third: whom she called [???]. After whose birth [???] 
she ceased to bear any more.
 
38:6. And [???] took a wife for her [???] his first born [???] whose name was 
[???].
 
38:7. And her [???] the first born of [???] [???] was wicked in the sight of the 
lord: and was slain by him.
 
38:8. [???] [???] therefore [???] said to [???] his son: go in to thy brother's wife 
and marry her [???] that thou mayst raise seed to thy brother.
 
38:9. He knowing that the children should not be his [???] when he went in to 
his brother's wife [???] he [???] his seed upon the ground [???] lest children 
should be born in his brother's name.
 
38:10. And therefore the lord slew him [???] because he did a [???] 
thing:
 
38:11. Wherefore [???] said to [???] his daughter-in-law: remain a widow 
in thy father's house [???] till [???] my son grow up: for he was afraid lest 
he also might die [???] as his brethren did. She went her way [???] and [???] in 
her father's house.
 
38:12. And after many days were past: the daughter of sue the wife of 
[???] died: and when he had taken comfort after his mourning [???] he went up 
to [???] [???] to the [???] of his sheep [???] he and [???] the [???] [???] 
the shepherd of his flock.
 
38:13. And it was told [???] that her father-in-law was come up to 
[???] to [???] his sheep.
 
38:14. And she put off the garments of her [???] [???] and took a veil:
and changing her dress [???] sat in the cross way [???] that [???] to [???]:
because [???] was grown up [???] and she had not been married to him.
 
38:15. When [???] saw her [???] he thought she was a harlot: for she had 
covered her face [???] lest she should be known.
 
38:16. And going to her [???] he said: suffer me to lie with thee: for he 
knew her not to be his daughter-in-law. And she answered: what wilt thou 
give me to enjoy my company?
 
38:17. He said: i will send thee a [???] out of the flock. And when she 
said again: i will suffer what thou wilt [???] if thou give me a pledge [???] till 
thou send what thou [???].
 
38:18. [???] said: what wilt thou have for a pledge? she answered: thy 
ring and [???] [???] and the staff which thou [???] in thy hand. The 
woman therefore at one [???] [???].
 
38:19. And she arose and went her way: and putting off the apparel which 
she had taken [???] put on the garments of her [???].
 
38:20. And [???] sent a [???] by his shepherd [???] the [???] [???] that he 
might receive the pledge again [???] which he had given to the woman: but he [???] 
not finding her [???] 
 
38:21. Asked the men of that place: where is the woman that sat in the 
cross way? and when they all made answer: there was no harlot in this 
place [???] 
 
38:22. He returned to [???] [???] and said to him: i have not found her;
moreover [???] the men of that place said to me [???] that there never sat a 
harlot there.
 
38:23. [???] said: let her take it to herself [???] surely she cannot charge 
us with a lie [???] i sent the [???] which i promised: and thou didst not find 
her.
 
38:24. And behold [???] after three months [???] they told [???] [???] saying: [???] [???] 
thy daughter-in-law [???] hath played the harlot [???] and she [???] to have a 
big belly. And [???] said: bring her out that she may be burnt.
 
38:25. But when she was led to execution [???] she sent to her father-in-law [???] 
saying: by the man [???] to whom these things belong [???] i am with child. See 
whose ring [???] and [???] [???] and staff this is.
 
38:26. But he [???] the gifts [???] said: she is [???] than i:
because i did not give her to [???] [???] my son. However he knew her no more.
 
38:27. And when she was ready to be brought to bed [???] there appeared [???] 
in her womb: and in the very [???] of the [???] [???] one put forth a 
hand [???] whereon the [???] tied a scarlet thread [???] saying:
 
38:28. This shall come forth the first.
 
38:29. But he drawing back his hand [???] the other came forth: and the woman 
said: why is the [???] divided for thee? and therefore called his 
name [???].
 
[???]... That is [???] a breach or division.
 
38:30. Afterwards his brother came out [???] on whose hand was the scarlet 
thread: and she called his name [???].
 
[???] chapter 39
 
joseph hath charge of his master's house: [???] his mistress's 
[???]: is falsely [???] by her [???] and cast into prison [???] where he 
hath the charge of all the prisoners.
 
39:1. And joseph was brought into egypt [???] and [???] [???] an eunuch of 
[???] [???] chief captain of the army [???] an egyptian [???] bought him of the 
[???] [???] by whom he was brought.
 
39:2. And the lord was with him [???] and he was a prosperous man in all 
things: and he [???] in his master's house:
 
39:3. Who knew very well that the lord was with him [???] and made all that 
he did to prosper in his hand.
 
39:4. And joseph found favour in the sight of his master [???] and [???] 
to him: and being set over all by him [???] he [???] the house committed 
to him [???] and all things that were delivered to him:
 
39:5. And the lord blessed the house of the egyptian for joseph's sake [???] 
and [???] all his substance [???] both at home and in the fields.
 
39:6. Neither knew he any other thing [???] but the bread which he ate. And 
joseph was of a beautiful countenance [???] and [???] to behold.
 
39:7. And after many days [???] his mistress cast her eyes on joseph [???] and 
said: lie with me.
 
39:8. But he in no wise [???] to that wicked act said to her:
behold [???] my master hath delivered all things to me [???] and [???] not what 
he hath in his own house:
 
39:9. Neither is there any thing which is not in my power [???] or that he 
hath not delivered to me [???] but thee [???] who art his wife; how then can i do 
this wicked thing [???] and sin against my god?
 
39:10. With such words as these day by day [???] both the woman was 
[???] with the young man [???] and he refused the [???].
 
39:11. Now it happened on a certain day [???] that joseph went into the 
house [???] and was doing some business [???] without any man with him:
 
39:12. And she catching the [???] of his garment [???] said: lie with me. But 
he leaving the garment in her hand [???] fled [???] and went out.
 
39:13. And when the woman saw the garment in her hands [???] and herself 
[???] [???] 
 
39:14. She called to her the men of her house [???] and said to them: see [???] he 
hath brought in a [???] [???] to abuse us: he came in to me [???] to lie with me;
and when i cried out [???] 
 
39:15. And he heard my voice [???] he left the garment that i held [???] and got 
him out.
 
39:16. For a proof therefore of her [???] [???] she kept the garment [???] and 
[???] it to her husband when he returned home:
 
a proof of her [???]... Or an argument to gain credit [???] [???] 
[???].
 
39:17. And said: the [???] servant [???] whom thou hast brought [???] came to me 
to abuse me.
 
39:18. And when he heard me cry [???] he left the garment which i held [???] and 
fled out.
 
39:19. His master hearing these things [???] and giving too much credit to 
his wife's words [???] was very angry [???] 
 
39:20. And cast joseph into the prison [???] where the king's prisoners were 
kept [???] and he was there shut up.
 
39:21. But the lord was with joseph [???] and having mercy upon him gave him 
favour in the sight of the chief keeper of the prison:
 
39:22. Who delivered into his hand all the prisoners that were kept in 
[???]: and whatsoever was done [???] was under him.
 
39:23. Neither did he himself know any thing [???] having committed all 
things to him: for the lord was with him [???] and made all that he did to 
prosper.
 
[???] chapter 40
 
joseph [???] the dreams of two of [???]'s servants in prison:
the event [???] the [???] to be true [???] but joseph is 
forgotten.
 
40:1. After this [???] it came to pass [???] that two [???] [???] the [???] and the 
[???] of the king of egypt [???] offended their lord.
 
40:2. And [???] being angry with them [???] (now the one was chief [???] [???] 
the other chief [???] [???])
 
40:3. He sent them to the prison of the commander of the soldiers [???] in 
which joseph also was prisoner.
 
40:4. But the keeper of the prison delivered them to joseph [???] and he 
served them. Some little time passed [???] and they were kept in [???].
 
40:5. And they both [???] a dream the same night [???] according to the 
[???] [???] to themselves:
 
40:6. And when joseph was come into them in the morning [???] and saw them 
sad [???] 
 
40:7. He asked them [???] saying: why is your countenance [???] today than 
usual?
 
40:8. They answered: we have [???] a dream [???] and there is nobody to 
[???] it to us. And joseph said to them: doth not [???] 
belong to god? tell me what you have [???]:
 
doth not [???] belong to god?... When dreams are from god [???] as 
these were [???] the [???] of them is a gift of god. But the 
[???] of dreams are not of this sort; but either proceed from the 
natural [???] and [???] of persons [???] or the [???] of their 
[???] in the day on such objects as they are much affected with [???] 
or from their mind being disturbed with cares and troubles [???] and 
oppressed with [???] [???]: or they are suggested by evil 
spirits [???] to flatter [???] or to [???] weak minds [???] in order to gain belief [???] 
and so draw them into error or [???]; or at least to trouble them 
in their sleep [???] whom they cannot move when they are awake: so that the 
general rule [???] with regard to dreams [???] is not to observe them [???] nor to give 
any credit to them.
 
40:9. The chief [???] first told his dream: i saw before me a vine [???] 
 
40:10. On which were three branches [???] which by little and little sent out 
buds [???] and after the [???] brought forth ripe [???]:
 
40:11. And the cup of [???] was in my hand: and i took the [???] [???] and 
pressed them into the cup which i held [???] and i gave the cup to [???].
 
40:12. Joseph answered: this is the [???] of the dream: the 
three branches [???] are yet three days:
 
40:13. After which [???] will remember thy service [???] and will restore 
thee to thy former place: and thou shalt present him the cup according 
to thy office [???] as before thou was wont to do.
 
40:14. Only remember me when it shall be well with thee [???] and do me this 
kindness: to put [???] in mind to take me out of this prison:
 
40:15. For i was stolen away out of the land of the [???] [???] and here 
without any fault was cast into the [???].
 
40:16. The chief [???] seeing that he had wisely [???] the dream [???] 
said: i also [???] a dream [???] that i had three [???] of meal upon my 
head:
 
40:17. And that in one basket which was [???] [???] i carried all [???] 
that are made by the art of [???] [???] and that the birds ate out of it.
 
40:18. Joseph answered: this is the [???] of the dream: the 
three [???] [???] are yet three days:
 
40:19. After which [???] will take thy head from thee [???] and hang thee on 
a cross [???] and the birds shall tear thy flesh.
 
40:20. The third day after this was the [???] of [???]: and he made 
a great feast for his servants [???] and at the banquet remembered the chief 
[???] [???] and the chief [???].
 
40:21. And he [???] the one to his place [???] to present him the cup:
 
40:22. The other he hanged on a [???] [???] that the truth of the 
[???] might be [???].
 
40:23. But the chief [???] [???] when things [???] with him [???] forgot his 
[???].
 
[???] chapter 41
 
joseph [???] the two dreams of [???]: he is made [???] over all 
egypt.
 
41:1. After two years [???] had a dream. He thought he stood by the 
river [???] 
 
41:2. Out of which came up seven [???] [???] very beautiful and fat: and they 
fed in [???] places.
 
41:3. Other seven also came up out of the river [???] ill-favoured [???] and lean 
[???]: and they fed on the very bank of the river [???] in green places:
 
41:4. And they [???] them [???] whose bodies were very beautiful and well 
[???]. So [???] [???].
 
41:5. He slept again [???] and [???] another dream: seven ears of corn came 
up upon one stalk full and fair:
 
41:6. Then seven other ears sprung up thin and [???] [???] 
 
41:7. And [???] all the beauty of the former. [???] [???] after his 
rest:
 
41:8. And when morning was come [???] being struck with fear [???] he sent to all 
the [???] of egypt [???] and to all the wise men: and they being 
called for [???] he told them his dream [???] and there was not any one that could 
[???] it.
 
41:9. Then at length the chief [???] [???] [???] said: i confess my 
sin:
 
41:10. The king being angry with his servants [???] commanded me and the 
chief [???] to be cast into the prison of the captain of the soldiers.
 
41:11. Where in one night both of us [???] a dream [???] things to 
come.
 
41:12. There was there a young man a [???] [???] servant to the same captain 
of the soldiers: to whom we told our dreams [???] 
 
41:13. And we heard what afterwards the event of the thing proved to be 
so. For i was [???] to my office: and he was hanged upon a [???].
 
41:14. Forthwith at the king's command joseph was brought out of the 
prison [???] and they [???] him: and changing his apparel brought him in to 
him.
 
41:15. And he said to him: i have [???] dreams [???] and there is no one 
that can [???] them: now i have heard that thou art very wise at 
[???] them:
 
41:16. Joseph answered: without me [???] god shall give [???] a prosperous 
answer.
 
41:17. So [???] told what he had [???]: methought i stood upon the 
bank of the river [???] 
 
41:18. And seven [???] came up out of the river [???] exceeding beautiful and 
full of flesh: and they [???] on green places in a [???] pasture.
 
41:19. And behold [???] there followed these [???] other seven [???] [???] so very ill-
favoured and lean [???] that i never saw the like in the land of egypt:
 
41:20. And they [???] and [???] the former [???] 
 
41:21. And yet gave no mark of their being full: but were as lean and 
ill-favoured as before. I [???] [???] and then fell asleep again [???] 
 
41:22. And [???] a dream: seven ears of corn grew up upon one stalk [???] 
full and very fair.
 
41:23. Other seven also thin and [???] [???] sprung of the stalk:
 
41:24. And they [???] the beauty of the former: i told this dream to 
the [???] [???] and there is no man that can [???] it.
 
41:25. Joseph answered: the king's dream is one: god hath [???] to 
[???] what he is about to do.
 
41:26. The seven beautiful [???] [???] and the seven full ears [???] are seven 
years of plenty: and both contain the same meaning of the dream.
 
41:27. And the seven lean and thin [???] that came up after them [???] and the 
seven thin ears that were [???] with the burning wind [???] are seven years 
of [???] to come:
 
41:28. Which shall be [???] in this order.
 
41:29. Behold [???] there shall come seven years of great plenty in the whole 
land of egypt:
 
41:30. After which shall follow other seven years of so great [???] [???] 
that all the abundance before shall be forgotten: for the [???] shall 
[???] all the land [???] 
 
41:31. And the greatness of the [???] shall destroy the greatness of 
the plenty.
 
41:32. And for that thou didst see the second time a dream [???] to 
the same thing: it is a token of the certainty [???] and that the word of god 
[???] to pass [???] and is [???] speedily.
 
41:33. Now therefore let the king provide a wise and [???] man [???] 
and make him [???] over the land of egypt:
 
41:34. That he may appoint [???] over all the countries: and gather 
into [???] the fifth part of the [???] [???] during the seven fruitful 
years [???] 
 
41:35. That shall now presently ensue: and let all the corn be laid up [???] 
under [???]'s hands [???] and be reserved in the cities.
 
41:36. And let it be in readiness [???] against the [???] of seven years to 
come [???] which shall oppress egypt [???] and the land shall not be [???] with 
[???].
 
41:37. The counsel pleased [???] [???] and all his servants.
 
41:38. And he said to them: can we find such another man [???] that is full 
of the spirit of god?
 
41:39. He said therefore to joseph: seeing god hath [???] thee all that 
thou hast said [???] can i find one wiser and one like unto thee?
 
41:40. Thou shalt be over my house [???] and at the commandment of thy mouth 
all the people shall obey: only in the kingly throne will i be above 
thee.
 
41:41. And again [???] said to joseph: behold [???] i have appointed thee 
over the whole land of egypt.
 
41:42. And he took his ring from his own hand [???] and gave it into his 
hand: and he put upon him a robe of silk [???] and put a chain of gold about 
his neck.
 
41:43. And he made him go up into his second [???] [???] the [???] 
[???] that all should bow their knee before him [???] and that they 
should know he was made governor over the whole land of egypt.
 
41:44. And the king said to joseph: i am [???]: without thy commandment 
no man shall move hand or foot in all the land of egypt.
 
41:45. And he turned his name [???] and called him in the egyptian tongue the 
[???] of the world. And he gave him to wife [???] [???] the daughter of 
[???] [???] priest of [???]. Then joseph went out to the land of 
egypt.
 
the [???] of the world... [???] [???].
 
41:46. (now he was thirty years old when he stood before king [???]) [???] 
and he went round all the countries of egypt.
 
41:47. And the [???] of the seven years came: and the corn being 
bound up into [???] [???] was [???] together into the [???] of egypt.
 
41:48. And all the abundance of grain was laid up in every city.
 
41:49. And there was so great abundance of wheat [???] that it was equal to 
the sand of the sea [???] and the plenty [???] measure.
 
41:50. And before the [???] came [???] joseph had two sons born: whom 
[???] [???] the daughter of [???] [???] priest of [???] [???] bore unto him.
 
41:51. And he called the name of the [???] [???] [???] saying: god 
hath made me to forget all my labours [???] and my father's house.
 
[???]... That is [???] oblivion [???] or [???].
 
41:52. And he named the second [???] [???] saying: god hath made me to grow 
in the land of my poverty.
 
[???]... That is [???] fruitful [???] or growing.
 
41:53. Now when the seven years of plenty that had been in egypt were 
passed:
 
41:54. The seven years of [???] [???] which joseph had [???] [???] began to 
come: and the [???] [???] in the whole world [???] but there was bread 
in all the land of egypt.
 
41:55. And when there also they began to be [???] [???] the people cried 
to [???] [???] for food. And he said to them: go to joseph: and do all that 
he shall say to you.
 
41:56. And the [???] [???] daily in all the land: and joseph opened 
all the [???] [???] and sold to the [???]: for the [???] had oppressed 
them also.
 
41:57. And all [???] came into egypt [???] to buy food [???] and to seek some 
relief of their want.
 
[???] chapter 42
 
[???] [???] his ten sons to buy corn in egypt. Their [???] by 
joseph.
 
42:1. And [???] hearing that food was sold in egypt [???] said to his sons:
why are ye careless?
 
42:2. I have heard that wheat is sold in egypt: go ye down [???] and buy us 
[???] [???] that we may live [???] and not be [???] with want.
 
42:3. So the ten brethren of joseph went down [???] to buy corn in egypt:
 
42:4. Whilst [???] was kept at home by [???] [???] who said to his 
brethren: lest perhaps he take any harm in the journey.
 
42:5. And they entered into the land of egypt with others that went to 
buy. For the [???] was in the land of [???].
 
42:6. And joseph was governor in the land of egypt [???] and corn was sold by 
his direction to the people. And when his brethren had [???] down to 
him [???] 
 
42:7. And he knew them [???] he spoke as it were to strangers [???] somewhat 
[???] [???] asking them: whence came you? they answered: from the land of 
[???] [???] to buy [???] of life.
 
42:8. And though he knew his brethren [???] he was not known by them.
 
42:9. And [???] the dreams [???] which [???] he had [???] [???] he said 
to them: you are spies. You are come to view the weaker parts of the 
land.
 
you are spies... This he said by way of [???] them [???] to see what they 
would answer.
 
42:10. But they said: it is not so [???] my lord; but thy servants are come 
to buy food.
 
42:11. We are all the sons of one man: we are come as [???] men [???] 
neither do thy servants go about any evil.
 
42:12. And he answered them: it is otherwise: you are come to consider 
the [???] parts of this land.
 
42:13. But they said: we thy servants are twelve brethren [???] the sons of 
one man in the land of [???]: the youngest is with our father [???] the 
other is not living.
 
42:14. He [???] [???] this is it that i said: you are spies.
 
42:15. I shall now presently try what you are: by the health of [???] [???] 
you shall not depart hence [???] until your youngest brother come.
 
42:16. Send one of you to fetch him: and you shall be in prison [???] till 
what you have said be proved [???] whether it be true or false: or else by 
the health of [???] you are spies.
 
or else by the health of [???] you are spies... That is [???] if these 
things you say be proved false [???] you are to be held for spies for your 
lying [???] and shall be treated as such. Joseph dealt in this manner with 
his brethren [???] to bring them by the means of affliction to a sense of 
their former sin [???] and a [???] [???] for it.
 
42:17. So he put them in prison three days.
 
42:18. And the third day he brought them out of prison [???] and said: do as 
i have said [???] and you shall live: for i fear god.
 
42:19. If you be [???] men [???] let one of your brethren be bound in 
prison: and go ye your ways [???] and carry the corn that you have bought [???] 
unto your houses.
 
42:20. And bring your youngest brother to me [???] that i may find your words 
to be true [???] and you may not die. They did as he had said.
 
42:21. And they talked one to another: we deserve to suffer these 
things [???] because we have [???] against our brother [???] seeing the [???] 
of his soul [???] when he [???] us [???] and we would not hear: therefore is 
this affliction come upon us.
 
42:22. And [???] [???] one of them [???] said: did not i say to you: do not sin 
against the boy; and you would not hear me? behold his blood is 
required.
 
42:23. And they knew not that joseph understood [???] because he spoke to 
them by an [???].
 
42:24. And he turned himself away a little while [???] and wept: and 
returning [???] he spoke to them.
 
42:25. And taking [???] [???] and [???] him in their presence [???] he 
commanded his servants to fill their [???] with wheat [???] and to put every 
man's money again in their [???] [???] and to give them besides [???] 
for the way: and they did so.
 
42:26. But they having [???] their [???] with the corn went their way.
 
42:27. And one of them opening his sack [???] to give his beast [???] in 
the inn [???] saw the money in the sack's mouth [???] 
 
42:28. And said to his brethren: my money is given me again; behold it 
is in the sack. And they were [???] [???] and troubled [???] and said to one 
another: what is this that god hath done unto us?
 
42:29. And they came to [???] their father in the land of [???] [???] and 
they told him all things that had [???] them [???] saying:
 
42:30. The lord of the land spoke [???] to us [???] and took us to be spies 
of the country.
 
42:31. And we answered him: we are [???] men [???] and we mean no plot.
 
42:32. We are twelve brethren born of one father: one is not living [???] the 
youngest is with our father in the land of [???].
 
42:33. And he said to us: [???] shall i know that you are [???] 
men: leave one of your brethren with me [???] and take ye necessary [???] 
for your houses [???] and go your ways [???] 
 
42:34. And bring your youngest brother to me [???] that i may know you are 
not spies: and you may receive this man again [???] that is kept in prison:
and afterwards may have leave to buy what you will.
 
42:35. When they had told this [???] they [???] out their corn [???] and every 
man found his money tied in the mouth of his sack: and all being 
[???] together [???] 
 
42:36. Their father [???] said: you have made me to be without children:
joseph is not living [???] [???] is kept in bonds [???] and [???] you will 
take away: all these evils are fallen upon me.
 
42:37. And [???] answered him: kill my two sons [???] if i bring him not 
again to thee: deliver him into my hand [???] and i will restore him to thee.
 
42:38. But he said: my son shall not go down with you: his brother is 
dead [???] and he is left alone: if any mischief befall him in the land to 
which you go [???] you will bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to hell.
 
to hell... That is [???] to that place [???] where the souls then remained [???] as 
above [???] chapter 37. Ver. 35.
 
[???] chapter 43
 
the sons of [???] go again into egypt with [???]. They are 
[???] by joseph.
 
43:1. In the mean time the [???] was heavy upon all the land.
 
43:2. And when they had eaten up all the corn [???] which they had brought 
out of egypt [???] [???] said to his sons: go again [???] and buy us a little 
food.
 
43:3. [???] answered: the man [???] unto us with the [???] of an 
oath [???] saying: you shall not see my face [???] unless you bring your youngest 
brother with you.
 
43:4. If therefore thou wilt send him with us [???] we will set out together [???] 
and will buy [???] for thee.
 
43:5. But if thou wilt not [???] we will not go: for the man [???] as we have 
often said [???] [???] unto us [???] saying: you shall not see my face without 
your youngest brother.
 
43:6. [???] said to them: you have done this for my misery [???] in that you 
told him you had also another brother.
 
43:7. But they answered: the man asked us in order concerning our 
kindred: if our father lived: if we had a brother: and we answered him 
[???] [???] according to what he demanded: could we know that he would 
say: bring hither your brother with you?
 
43:8. And [???] said to his father: send the boy with me [???] that we may set 
forward [???] and may live: lest both we and our children perish.
 
43:9. I take the boy upon me [???] require him at my hand: unless i bring him 
again [???] and restore him to thee [???] i will be guilty of sin against thee for 
ever.
 
43:10. If delay had not been made [???] we had been here again the second 
time.
 
43:11. Then [???] said to them: if it must needs be so [???] do what you 
will: take of the best [???] of the land in your [???] [???] and carry 
down presents to the man [???] a little balm [???] and honey [???] and [???] [???] [???] [???] 
[???] [???] and [???].
 
balm... [???] [???] [???] [???]; but here by that name is meant balm.
 
43:12. And take with you double money [???] and carry back what you found in 
your [???] [???] lest perhaps it was done by mistake.
 
43:13. And take also your brother [???] and go to the man.
 
43:14. And may my [???] god make him [???] to you: and send back 
with you your brother [???] whom he [???] [???] and this [???]: and as for me 
i shall be [???] without children.
 
43:15. So the men took the presents [???] and double money [???] and [???]: and 
went down into egypt [???] and stood before joseph.
 
43:16. And when he had seen them [???] and [???] with them [???] he commanded 
the steward of his house [???] saying: bring in the men into the house [???] and 
kill [???] [???] and prepare a feast: because they shall eat with me at 
noon.
 
43:17. He did as he was commanded [???] and brought the men into the house.
 
43:18. And they being much afraid [???] said there one to another: because of 
the money [???] which we carried back the first time in our [???] [???] we are 
brought in: that he may bring upon us a false [???] [???] and by 
violence make slaves of us and our [???].
 
43:19. Wherefore [???] going up to the steward of the house [???] at the door [???] 
 
43:20. They said: sir [???] we desire thee to hear us. We came down once 
before to buy food:
 
43:21. And when we had bought [???] and were come to the inn [???] we opened our 
[???] [???] and found our money in the mouths of the [???]: which we have now 
brought again in the same weight.
 
43:22. And we have brought other money besides [???] to buy what we want: we 
cannot tell who put it in our bags.
 
43:23. But he answered: peace be with you [???] fear not: your god [???] and the 
god of your father [???] hath given you treasure in your [???]. For the 
money [???] which you gave me [???] i have for good. And he brought [???] out to 
them.
 
43:24. And having brought them into the house [???] he [???] water [???] and 
they washed their feet [???] and he gave [???] to their [???].
 
43:25. But they made ready the presents [???] against joseph came at noon:
for they had heard that they should eat bread there.
 
43:26. Then joseph came in to his house [???] and they offered him the 
presents [???] holding them in their hands; and they [???] down with their 
face to the ground.
 
43:27. But he [???] [???] them again [???] asked them [???] saying: is 
the old man your father in health [???] of whom you told me? is he yet 
living?
 
43:28. And they answered: thy servant our father [???] is in health; he is 
yet living. And [???] themselves [???] they made [???] to him.
 
43:29. And joseph [???] up his eyes [???] saw [???] [???] his brother by the 
same mother [???] and said: is this your young brother [???] of whom you told me?
and he said: god be gracious to thee [???] my son.
 
43:30. And he made haste [???] because his heart was moved upon his brother [???] 
and tears [???] out: and going into his chamber [???] he wept.
 
43:31. And when he had washed his face [???] coming out again [???] he [???] 
himself [???] and said: set bread on the table.
 
43:32. And when it was set on [???] for joseph apart [???] and for his brethren 
apart [???] for the [???] also that ate with him apart [???] (for it is 
[???] for the [???] to eat with the [???] [???] and they think such 
a feast profane):
 
43:33. They sat before him [???] the [???] according to his [???] [???] 
and the youngest according to his age. And they wondered very much;
 
43:34. Taking the [???] which they received of him: and the greater 
mess came to [???] [???] so that it [???] by five parts. And they 
drank [???] and were merry with him.
 
[???] chapter 44
 
joseph's [???] to stop his brethren. The humble [???] of 
[???].
 
44:1. And joseph commanded the steward of his house [???] saying: fill their 
[???] with corn [???] as much as they can hold: and put the money of every 
one in the top of his sack.
 
44:2. And in the mouth of the younger's sack put my silver cup [???] and the 
price which he gave for the wheat. And it was so done.
 
44:3. And when the morning arose [???] they were sent away with their [???].
 
44:4. And when they were now departed out of the city [???] and had gone 
forward a little way: joseph sending for the steward of his house [???] said:
arise [???] and pursue after the men: and when thou hast [???] them [???] say 
to them: why have you returned evil for good?
 
44:5. The cup which you have stolen [???] is that in which my lord [???] [???] 
and in which he is wont to divine: you have done a very evil thing.
 
44:6. He did as he had commanded him. And having [???] them [???] he 
spoke to them the same words.
 
44:7. And they answered: why doth our lord speak so [???] as though thy 
servants had committed so heinous a fact?
 
44:8. The money [???] that we found in the top of our [???] [???] we brought back 
to thee from the land of [???]: how then should it be that we should 
steal out of thy lord's house [???] gold or silver?
 
44:9. With [???] of thy servants shall be found that which thou 
[???] [???] let him die [???] and we will be the [???] of my lord.
 
44:10. And he said to them: let it be according to your sentence: with 
[???] it shall be found [???] let him be my servant [???] and you shall be 
[???].
 
44:11. Then they speedily took down their [???] to the ground [???] and every 
man opened his sack.
 
44:12. Which when he had [???] [???] beginning at the eldest [???] and ending 
at the youngest [???] he found the cup in [???]'s sack.
 
44:13. Then they rent their garments [???] and [???] their [???] again [???] 
returned into the town.
 
44:14. And [???] at the head of his brethren went in to joseph (for he 
was not yet gone out of the place) and they all together fell down 
before him on the ground.
 
44:15. And he said to them: why would you do so? know you not that there 
is no one like me in the [???] of [???].
 
the [???] of [???]... He speaks of himself according to what he was 
[???] in that kingdom. And indeed [???] he being truly a prophet [???] knew 
more without comparison than any of the egyptian [???].
 
44:16. And [???] said to him: what shall we answer my lord? or what shall 
we say [???] or be able justly to [???]? god hath found out the iniquity of 
thy servants: behold [???] we are all [???] to my lord [???] both we [???] and he 
with whom the cup was found.
 
44:17. Joseph answered: god forbid that i should do so: he that stole 
the cup [???] he shall be my [???]: and go you away free to your father.
 
44:18. Then [???] coming nearer [???] said boldly: i beseech thee [???] my lord [???] 
let thy servant speak a word in thy ears [???] and be not angry with thy 
servant: for after [???] thou art.
 
44:19. My lord. Thou didst ask thy servants the first time: have you a 
father or a brother.
 
44:20. And we answered thee [???] my lord: we have a father an old man [???] and a 
young boy [???] that was born in his old age; whose brother by the mother is 
dead; and he alone is left of his mother [???] and his father [???] him 
[???].
 
44:21. And thou [???] to thy servants: bring him hither to me [???] and i 
will set my eyes on him.
 
44:22. We suggested to my lord: the boy cannot leave his father: for if 
he leave him [???] he will die.
 
44:23. And thou [???] to thy servants: except your youngest brother 
come with you [???] you shall see my face no more.
 
44:24. Therefore when we were gone up to thy servant our father [???] we told 
him all that my lord had said.
 
44:25. And our father said: go again [???] and buy us a little wheat.
 
44:26. And we said to him: we cannot go: if our youngest brother go down 
with us [???] we will set out together: otherwise [???] without him we dare not 
see the man's face.
 
44:27. [???] he answered: you know that my wife bore me two.
 
44:28. One went out [???] and you said: a beast [???] him; and [???] he 
[???] not.
 
44:29. If you take this also [???] and any thing befall him in the way [???] you 
will bring down my grey hairs with sorrow unto hell.
 
44:30. Therefore [???] if i shall go to thy servant [???] our father [???] and the boy 
be wanting [???] (whereas his life [???] upon the life of him [???])
 
44:31. And he shall see that he is not with us [???] he will die [???] and thy 
servants shall bring down his grey hairs with sorrow unto hell.
 
his [???] hairs... That is [???] his person [???] now far [???] in years.-with 
sorrow unto hell... The [???] word for hell is here [???] [???] the greek 
[???]: it is not taken for the hell of the damned; but for that place of 
souls below where the servants of god were kept before the coming of 
christ. Which place [???] both in the [???] and in the [???] [???] is named 
hell.
 
44:32. Let me be thy proper servant [???] who took him into my trust [???] and 
promised [???] saying: if i bring him not again [???] i will be guilty of sin 
against my father for ever.
 
44:33. Therefore i [???] thy servant [???] will stay instead of the boy in the 
service of my lord [???] and let the boy go up with his brethren.
 
44:34. For i cannot return to my father without the boy [???] lest i be a 
witness of the [???] that will oppress my father.
 
[???] chapter 45
 
joseph [???] himself known to his brethren: and [???] for his father.
 
45:1. Joseph could no longer [???] himself before many that stood by:
whereupon he commanded that all should go out [???] and no stranger be 
present at their knowing one another.
 
45:2. And he lifted up his voice with weeping [???] which the [???] [???] and 
all the house of [???] heard.
 
45:3. And he said to his brethren: i am joseph: is my father yet living?
his brethren could not answer him [???] being struck with exceeding great 
fear.
 
45:4. And he said [???] to them: come nearer to me. And when they were 
come near him [???] he said: i am joseph [???] your brother [???] whom you sold into 
egypt.
 
45:5. Be not afraid [???] and let it not seem to you a hard case that you 
sold me into these countries: for god sent me before you into egypt for 
your [???].
 
45:6. For it is two years since the [???] began to be upon the land [???] 
and five years more remain [???] wherein there can be neither [???] nor 
[???].
 
45:7. And god sent me before [???] that you may be [???] upon the earth [???] 
and may have food to live.
 
45:8. Not by your counsel was i sent hither [???] but by the will of god: who 
hath made me as it were a father to [???] [???] and lord of his whole house [???] 
and governor in all the land of egypt.
 
45:9. Make haste [???] and go ye up to my father [???] and say to him: thus [???] 
thy son joseph: god hath made me lord of the whole land of egypt; come 
down to me [???] linger not.
 
45:10. And thou shalt dwell in the land of [???]: and thou shalt be 
near me [???] thou and thy sons [???] and thy sons'sons [???] thy sheep [???] and thy 
[???] [???] and all things that thou hast.
 
45:11. And there i will feed thee [???] (for there are yet five years of 
[???] remaining) lest both thou perish [???] and thy house [???] and all things 
that thou hast.
 
45:12. Behold [???] your eyes [???] and the eyes of my brother [???] [???] see that 
it is my mouth that [???] to you.
 
45:13. You shall tell my father of all my glory [???] and all things that you 
have seen in egypt: make haste and bring him to me.
 
45:14. And falling upon the neck of his brother [???] [???] he [???] 
him and wept: and [???] in like manner wept also on his neck.
 
45:15. And joseph [???] all his brethren [???] and wept upon every one of 
them: after which they were [???] to speak to him.
 
45:16. And it was heard [???] and the fame was spread abroad in the king's 
court: the brethren of joseph are come; and [???] with all his family 
was glad.
 
45:17. And he spoke to joseph that he should give orders to his 
brethren [???] saying: load your beasts [???] and go into the land of [???] [???] 
 
45:18. And bring away from thence your father and kindred [???] and come to 
me; and i will give you all the good things of egypt [???] that you may eat 
the [???] of the land.
 
45:19. Give orders also that they take [???] out of the land of egypt [???] 
for the carriage of their children and their wives; and say: take up 
your father [???] and make haste to come with all speed:
 
45:20. And leave nothing of your household stuff; for all the riches of 
egypt shall be yours.
 
45:21. And the sons of [???] did as they were bid. And joseph gave them 
[???] according to [???]'s commandment: and [???] for the way.
 
45:22. He ordered also to be brought out for every one of them two 
robes: but to [???] he gave three hundred pieces of silver [???] with five 
robes of the best:
 
45:23. Sending to his father as much money and [???]; adding besides [???] 
ten he-[???] [???] to carry off all the riches of egypt [???] and as many she-
[???] [???] carrying wheat and bread for the journey.
 
45:24. So he sent away his brethren [???] and at their [???] said to 
them: be not angry in the way.
 
45:25. And they went up out of egypt [???] and came into the land of [???] [???] 
to their father [???].
 
45:26. And they told him [???] saying: joseph [???] thy son [???] is living; and he is 
[???] in all the land of egypt. Which when [???] heard [???] he [???] as it 
were out of a deep sleep [???] yet did not believe them.
 
45:27. They [???] on the other side [???] told the whole order of the thing. And 
when he saw the [???] [???] and all that he had sent [???] his spirit [???] [???] 
 
45:28. And he said: it is enough for me if joseph [???] my son [???] be yet 
living: i will go and see him before i die.

46:34. You shall answer: we [???] thy servants [???] are [???] [???] from our 
infancy until now [???] both we and our fathers. And this you shall say [???] that 
you may dwell in the land of [???] [???] because the [???] have all 
[???] in [???].
 
[???] chapter 47
 
[???] and his sons are presented before [???]: he [???] them the land 
of [???]. The [???] [???] the [???] to sell all their 
[???] to the king.
 
47:1. Then joseph went in and told [???] [???] saying: my father and 
brethren [???] their sheep and their [???] [???] and all that they possess [???] are 
come out of the land of [???]: and behold they stay in the land of 
[???].
 
47:2. Five men also [???] the last of his brethren [???] he presented before the 
king:
 
the last... [???]. Some [???] this word of the chiefest [???] and most 
rightly: but joseph seems rather to have chosen out such as had the 
meanest appearance [???] that [???] might not think of [???] them at 
court [???] with danger of their [???] and religion.
 
47:3. And he asked them: what is your occupation? they answered: we [???] thy 
servants [???] are [???] [???] both we and our fathers.
 
47:4. We are come to [???] in thy land [???] because there is no grass for 
the [???] of thy servants [???] the [???] being very grievous in the land 
of [???]: and we pray thee to give orders that we thy servants may be 
in the land of [???].
 
47:5. The king therefore said to joseph: thy father and thy brethren are 
come to thee.
 
47:6. The land of egypt is before thee: and make them dwell in the best 
place [???] and give them the land of [???]. And if thou knowest that there 
are [???] men among them [???] make them [???] over my cattle.
 
47:7. After this joseph brought in his father to the king [???] and presented 
him before him: and he blessed him.
 
47:8. And being asked by him: how many are the days of the years of thy 
life?
 
47:9. He answered: the days of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty 
years [???] few [???] and evil [???] and they are not come up to the days of the 
pilgrimage of my fathers.
 
47:10. And blessing the king [???] he went out.
 
47:11. But joseph gave a possession to his father and his brethren in 
egypt [???] in the best place of the land [???] in [???] [???] as [???] had 
commanded.
 
47:12. And he [???] them [???] and all his father's house [???] [???] food 
to every one.
 
47:13. For in the whole world there was want of bread [???] and a [???] had 
oppressed the land [???] more especially of egypt and [???];
 
47:14. Out of which he [???] up all the money for the corn which they 
bought [???] and brought it in to the king's treasure.
 
47:15. And when the [???] wanted money [???] all egypt came to joseph [???] 
saying: give us bread: why should we die in thy presence [???] having now no 
money?
 
47:16. And he answered them: bring me your cattle [???] and for them i will 
give you food [???] if you have no money.
 
47:17. And when they had brought them [???] he gave them food in exchange for 
their horses [???] and sheep [???] and [???] [???] and [???]: and he [???] them 
that year for the exchange of their cattle.
 
47:18. And they came the second year [???] and said to him: we will not hide 
from our lord [???] how that our money is spent [???] and our cattle also are 
gone: neither art thou ignorant that we have nothing now left but our 
bodies and our lands.
 
47:19. Why therefore shall we die before thy eyes? we will be thine [???] 
both we and our lands: buy us to be the king's servants [???] and give us 
seed [???] lest for want of [???] the land be turned into a wilderness.
 
47:20. So joseph bought all the land of egypt [???] every man [???] his 
[???] [???] because of the greatness of the [???]. And he brought it 
into [???]'s hands:
 
47:21. And all its people from one end of the [???] of egypt [???] even to 
the other end thereof [???] 
 
47:22. Except the land of the priests [???] which had been given them by the 
king: to whom also a certain allowance of food was given out of the 
public [???] [???] and therefore they were not forced to sell their 
[???].
 
47:23. Then joseph said to the people: behold [???] as you see [???] both you and 
your lands belong to [???]; take seed and sow the fields [???] 
 
47:24. That you may have corn. The fifth part you shall give to the 
king; the other four you shall have for seed [???] and for food for your 
[???] and children.
 
47:25. And they answered: our life is in thy hand; only let my lord look 
[???] upon us [???] and we will gladly serve the king.
 
47:26. From that time unto this day [???] in the whole land of egypt [???] the 
fifth part is paid to the kings [???] and it is become as a law [???] except the 
land of the priests [???] which was free from this [???].
 
47:27. So [???] [???] in egypt [???] that is [???] in the land of [???] [???] and 
possessed it; and grew [???] and was [???] exceedingly.
 
47:28. And he lived in it [???] years: and all the days of his life 
came to a hundred and forty-seven years.
 
47:29. And when he saw that the day of his death drew nigh [???] he called 
his son joseph [???] and said to him: if i have found favour in thy sight [???] 
put thy hand under my thigh; and thou shalt [???] me this kindness and 
truth [???] not to bury me in egypt.
 
47:30. But i will sleep with my fathers [???] and thou shalt take me away out 
of this land [???] and bury me in the [???] place of my ancestors. And 
joseph answered him: i will do what thou hast commanded.
 
47:31. And he said: swear then to me. And as he was swearing [???] [???] 
[???] god [???] turning to the bed's head.
 
to the bed's head... St. Paul [???] [???]. 11. 21 [???] following the greek 
[???] of the [???] [???] reads [???] the top of his rod. Where 
note [???] that the same word in the [???] [???] according to the different 
pointing of it [???] [???] both a bed and a rod. And to [???] both these 
[???] [???] we must understand that [???] leaning on joseph's rod [???] [???] 
turning towards the head of his bed: which [???] [???] [???] as it was 
referred to god [???] was an absolute and sovereign worship: but [???] as 
it was referred to the rod of joseph [???] as a figure of the sceptre [???] that 
is [???] of the royal dignity of christ [???] was only an inferior and [???] 
honour.
 
[???] chapter 48
 
joseph [???] his father in his sickness [???] who [???] his two sons 
[???] and [???] [???] and [???] them [???] [???] the younger before 
the elder.
 
48:1. After these things [???] it was told joseph that his father was sick;
and he set out to go to him [???] taking his two sons [???] and [???].
 
48:2. And it was told the old man: behold thy son joseph [???] to thee.
and being [???] [???] he sat on his bed.
 
48:3. And when joseph was come in to him [???] he said: god [???] 
appeared to me at [???] [???] which is in the land of [???] [???] and he blessed 
me [???] 
 
48:4. And said: i will cause thee to increase and [???] [???] and i will 
make of thee a multitude of people: and i will give this land to thee [???] 
and to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.
 
48:5. So thy two sons [???] who were born to thee in the land of egypt before 
i came hither to thee [???] shall be mine: [???] and [???] shall be 
[???] to me as [???] and [???].
 
48:6. But the rest whom thou shalt have after them [???] shall be thine [???] and 
shall be called by the name of their brethren in their [???].
 
48:7. For [???] when i came out of [???] [???] [???] died from me in the 
land of [???] in the very journey [???] and it was spring time: and i was 
going to [???] [???] and i buried her near the way of [???] [???] which by 
another name is called [???].
 
48:8. Then seeing his sons [???] he said to him: who are these?
 
48:9. He answered: they are my sons [???] whom god hath given me in this 
place. And he said: bring them to me [???] that i may bless them.
 
48:10. For [???]'s eyes were dim by reason of his great age [???] and he 
could not see clearly. And when they were brought to him [???] he [???] and 
[???] them [???] 
 
48:11. And said to his son: i am not [???] of seeing thee; moreover 
god hath [???] me thy seed.
 
48:12. And when joseph had taken them from his father's lap [???] he [???] 
down with his face to the ground.
 
48:13. And he set [???] on his right hand [???] that is [???] towards the left 
hand of [???]; but [???] on his left hand [???] to wit [???] towards his 
father's right hand [???] and brought them near to him.
 
48:14. But he [???] [???] forth his right hand [???] put it upon the head of 
[???] [???] the younger brother; and the left upon the head of [???] [???] 
who was the elder [???] changing his hands.
 
48:15. And [???] blessed the sons of joseph [???] and said: god [???] in whose 
sight my fathers [???] and [???] walked [???] god that [???] me from my 
youth until this day:
 
48:16. The angel that [???] me from all evils [???] bless these boys:
and let my name be called upon them [???] and the names of my fathers [???] 
and [???]; and may they grow into a multitude upon the earth.
 
48:17. And joseph seeing that his father had put his right hand upon the 
head of [???] [???] was much [???]: and taking his father's hand [???] he 
tried to lift it from [???]'s head [???] and to remove it to the head of 
[???].
 
48:18. And he said to his father: it should not be so [???] my father; for 
this is the [???] [???] put thy right hand upon his head.
 
48:19. But he [???] [???] said: i know [???] my son [???] i know: and this also 
shall become a people [???] and shall be [???]; but his younger brother 
shall be greater than he; and his seed shall grow into [???].
 
48:20. And he blessed them at that time [???] saying: in thee shall [???] be 
blessed [???] and it shall be said: god do to thee as to [???] [???] and as to 
[???]. And he set [???] before [???].
 
48:21. And he said to joseph [???] his son: behold i die [???] and god will be 
with you [???] and will bring you back into the land of your fathers.
 
48:22. I give thee a [???] above thy brethren [???] which i took out of the 
hand of the [???] with my sword and bow.
 
[???] chapter 49
 
[???]'s [???] blessings of his twelve sons: his death.
 
49:1. And [???] called his sons [???] and said to them: gather yourselves 
together [???] that i may tell you the things that shall befall you in the 
last days.
 
49:2. Gather yourselves together [???] and hear [???] o ye sons of [???] [???] [???] 
to [???] [???] your father:
 
49:3. [???] [???] my [???] [???] thou art my strength [???] and the beginning of my 
sorrow; [???] in gifts [???] greater in command.
 
my strength [???] etc... He calls him his strength [???] as being born whilst his 
father was in his full strength and vigour: he calls him the beginning 
of his sorrow [???] because cares and sorrows usually come on with the birth 
of children. [???] in gifts [???] etc. [???] because the [???] had a title 
to a double [???] [???] and to have the command over his brethren [???] which 
[???] [???] by his sin; being [???] out as water [???] that is [???] [???] 
and lost.
 
49:4. Thou art [???] out as water [???] grow thou not; because thou [???] 
up to thy father's bed [???] and didst [???] his couch.
 
grow thou not... This was not meant by way of a curse or [???];
but by way of a [???] [???] that the tribe of [???] should not 
inherit the pre-[???] usually [???] to the first [???] [???] viz. [???] 
the double [???] [???] the being prince or lord over the other brethren [???] 
and the [???]: of which the double [???] was given to joseph [???] the 
princely office to [???] [???] and the [???] to [???].
 
49:5. [???] and [???] brethren: [???] of iniquity [???] war.
 
49:6. Let not my soul go into their counsel [???] nor my glory be in their 
assembly: because in their fury they slew a man [???] and in their self-will 
they [???] a wall.
 
slew a man [???]... Viz. [???] [???] the son of [???] [???] with all his people [???] gen.
34.; [???] and [???] it [???] to christ [???] whom their 
posterity [???] viz. [???] the priests and the [???] [???] put to death.
 
49:7. Cursed be their fury [???] because it was stubborn: and their wrath [???] 
because it was cruel: i will divide them in [???] [???] and will scatter them 
in [???].
 
49:8. [???] [???] thee shall thy brethren praise: thy hand shall be on the 
[???] of thy enemies; the sons of thy father shall bow down to thee.
 
49:9. [???] is a lion's [???]: to the prey [???] my son [???] thou art gone up:
[???] thou hast [???] as a lion [???] and as a [???] [???] who shall rouse 
him?
 
a lion's [???] [???] etc... This blessing of [???] [???] the strength of 
his tribe [???] the [???] of his inheritance; and [???] that the 
sceptre and [???] power should not be utterly taken away from his 
race till about the time of the coming of christ: as in effect it never 
was: which is a [???] against the [???] [???] [???] that the [???] 
is long since come; for the sceptre has long since been utterly taken 
away from [???].
 
49:10. The sceptre shall not be taken away from [???] [???] nor a [???] from 
his thigh [???] till he come that is to be sent [???] and he shall be the 
expectation of [???].
 
49:11. [???] his [???] to the [???] [???] and his ass [???] o my son [???] to the 
vine. He shall wash his robe in wine [???] and his garment in the blood of 
the [???].
 
49:12. His eyes are more beautiful than wine [???] and his teeth [???] than 
milk.
 
49:13. [???] shall dwell on the [???] [???] and in the road of ships [???] 
[???] as far as [???].
 
49:14. [???] shall be a strong ass [???] lying down between the [???].
 
49:15. He saw rest that it was good: and the land that it was excellent:
and he [???] his shoulder to carry [???] and became a servant under tribute.
 
49:16. [???] shall judge his people like another tribe in [???].
 
[???] shall judge [???] etc... This was [???] in [???] [???] who was of the 
tribe of [???] [???] and began to deliver [???]. [???] 13. 5. But as this 
[???] was but [???] and very [???] [???] the holy [???] 
(ver. 18) [???] after another kind of [???] [???] saying: i will look 
for thy [???] [???] o lord.
 
49:17. Let [???] be a [???] in the way [???] a serpent in the path [???] that [???] 
the horse's heels [???] that his rider may fall backward.
 
49:18. I will look for thy [???] [???] o lord.
 
49:19. Gad [???] being [???] [???] shall fight before him: and he himself shall 
be [???] backward.
 
gad being [???] [???] etc... It seems to [???] to the tribe of gad; when 
after they had received for their lot the land of [???] [???] they [???] 
in arms before the rest of the [???] [???] to the conquest of the land 
of [???]: from whence they afterwards returned [???] with [???]. See 
[???]. 4. And 12.
 
49:20. [???] [???] his bread shall be fat [???] and he shall yield [???] to 
kings.
 
49:21. [???] [???] a hart let loose [???] and giving words of beauty.
 
49:22. Joseph is a growing son [???] a growing son and [???] to behold: the 
daughters run to and fro upon the wall;
 
run to and fro [???] etc... To behold his beauty; whilst his envious brethren 
turned their darts against him [???] etc.
 
49:23. But they that held darts [???] [???] him [???] and [???] with him [???] 
and [???] him.
 
49:24. His bow [???] upon the strong [???] and the bands of his arms and his 
hands were [???] [???] by the hands of the mighty one of [???]: thence he 
came forth a [???] [???] the stone of [???].
 
his bow [???] upon the strong [???] etc... That is [???] upon god [???] who was his 
strength: who also [???] his bands [???] and brought him out of prison to be 
the [???] [???] that is [???] the [???] and [???] of egypt [???] and the stone [???] that 
is [???] the rock and support of [???].
 
49:25. The god of thy father shall be thy [???] [???] and the [???] shall 
bless thee with the blessings of heaven above [???] with the blessings of the 
deep that [???] beneath [???] with the blessings of the breasts and of the 
womb.
 
49:26. The blessings of thy father are [???] with the blessings 
of his fathers: until the desire of the everlasting hills should come:
may they be upon the head of joseph [???] and upon the crown of the [???] 
among his brethren.
 
the blessings of thy father [???] etc... That is [???] thy father's blessings are 
made more [???] and [???] in thy regard [???] by the [???] 
strength they receive from his [???] the blessings of his 
[???] [???] and [???]. The desire of the everlasting hills [???] 
etc... These blessings all looked forward towards christ [???] called the 
desire of the everlasting hills [???] as being [???] for [???] as it were [???] by the 
whole [???]. [???] [???] the [???] and [???] are called the 
everlasting hills [???] by reason of the [???] of their wisdom and 
[???]. The [???]... This word [???] one [???]; and [???] 
to joseph [???] as being [???] from [???] and more [???] than [???] his brethren.
as the ancient [???] were so called from their being set aside for 
god [???] and [???] to him.
 
49:27. [???] a [???] wolf [???] in the morning shall eat the prey [???] and 
in the evening shall divide the spoil.
 
49:28. All these are the twelve [???] of [???]: these things their 
father spoke to them [???] and he blessed every one with their proper 
blessings.
 
49:29. And he charged them [???] saying: i am now going to be [???] to my 
people: bury me with my fathers in the double cave [???] which is in the 
field of [???] the [???] [???] 
 
to be [???] to my people... That is [???] i am going to die [???] and so to 
follow my ancestors that are gone before me [???] and to join their company 
in another world.
 
49:30. Over against [???] [???] in the land of [???] [???] which [???] bought 
together with the field [???] of [???] the [???] [???] for a possession to bury 
in.
 
49:31. There they buried him [???] and [???] his wife: there was [???] buried 
with [???] [???] his wife: there also [???] doth lie buried.
 
49:32. And when he had ended the [???] [???] wherewith he [???] 
his sons [???] he drew up his feet upon the bed [???] and died: and he was 
[???] to his people.
 
[???] chapter 50
 
the mourning for [???] [???] and his [???]. Joseph's kindness towards his 
brethren. His death.
 
50:1. And when joseph saw this [???] he fell upon his father's face [???] weeping 
and kissing him.
 
50:2. And he commanded his servants [???] the [???] [???] to [???] his 
father.
 
50:3. And while they were [???] his commands [???] there passed forty 
days: for this was the manner with bodies that were [???] [???] and egypt 
[???] for him [???] days.
 
50:4. And the time of the mourning being [???] [???] joseph spoke to the 
family of [???]: if i have found favour in your sight [???] speak in the 
ears of [???]:
 
50:5. For my father made me swear to him [???] saying: behold i die; thou 
shalt bury me in my [???] which i have [???] for myself in the land 
of [???]. So i will go up and bury my father [???] and return.
 
50:6. And [???] said to him: go up and bury thy father according as he 
made thee swear.
 
50:7. So he went up [???] and there went with him all the [???] of 
[???]'s house [???] and all the [???] of the land of egypt.
 
50:8. And the house of joseph with his brethren [???] except their children [???] 
and their [???] and [???] [???] which they left in the land of [???].
 
50:9. He had also in his train [???] and [???]: and it was a great 
company.
 
50:10. And they came to the [???] floor of [???] [???] which is [???] 
beyond the [???]: where [???] the [???] with a great and 
[???] [???] [???] they spent full seven days.
 
50:11. And when the [???] of [???] saw this [???] they said: this is 
a great mourning to the [???]. And therefore the name of that place 
was called [???] the mourning of egypt.
 
50:12. So the sons of [???] did as he had commanded them.
 
50:13. And carrying him into the land of [???] [???] they buried him in the 
double cave [???] which [???] had bought together with the field for a 
possession of a [???] place [???] of [???] [???] the [???] [???] over against

50:14. And joseph returned into egypt with his brethren [???] and all that 
were in his company [???] after he had buried his father.
 
50:15. Now he being dead [???] his brethren were afraid [???] and talked one with 
another: lest perhaps he should remember the wrong he suffered [???] and 
requite us all the evil that we did to him.
 
50:16. And they sent a message to him [???] saying: thy father commanded us 
before he died [???] 
 
50:17. That we should say thus much to thee from him: i beseech thee to 
forget the [???] of thy brethren [???] and the sin and malice they 
[???] against thee: we also pray thee [???] to forgive the servants of 
the god of thy father this [???]. And when joseph heard this [???] he 
wept.
 
50:18. And his brethren came to him; and [???] [???] on the 
ground [???] they said: we are thy servants.
 
50:19. And he answered them: fear not: can we resist the will of god?
 
50:20. You thought evil against me: but god turned it into good [???] that he 
might [???] me [???] as at present you see [???] and might save many people.
 
50:21. Fear not: i will feed you and your children. And he [???] 
them [???] and spoke gently and [???].
 
50:22. And he [???] in egypt with all his father's house; and lived a 
hundred and ten years. And he saw the children of [???] to the third 
generation. The children also of [???] [???] the sons of [???] [???] were born 
on joseph's knees.
 
50:23. After which he told his brethren: god will visit you after my 
death [???] and will make you go up out of this land [???] to the land which he 
swore to [???] [???] [???] [???] and [???].
 
50:24. And he made them swear to him [???] saying: god will visit you [???] carry 
my bones with you out of this place:

1:10. Come let us wisely oppress them [???] lest they [???]: and if any 
war shall rise against us [???] join with our enemies [???] and having overcome

1:19. They answered: the [???] women are not as the egyptian women: for 
they themselves are [???] in the office of a [???]; and they are 
delivered before we come to them.
 
1:20. Therefore god dealt well with the [???]: and the people 
[???] and grew exceedingly strong.
 
1:21. And because the [???] feared god [???] he built them houses.
 
because the [???] feared god [???] etc... The [???] were [???] [???] not 
for their lie [???] which was a [???] sin; but for their fear of god [???] and 
their humanity: but this reward was only [???] [???] in building them 
houses [???] that is [???] in [???] and [???] their [???].

female [???] ye shall save alive.

[???] the maids [???] [???] their sheep.
 
2:18: and when they returned to [???] their father [???] he said to them:
