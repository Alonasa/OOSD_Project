History 
 
 
This e-text comes from [???]ple editions of [???]s's revised [???]-
[???]ms version of the holy [???]. In 1568 english [???] [???] many from 
oxford [???] established the english [???]ge of douay ([???] [???] [???]) [???] [???] [???] 
under william (later cardinal) [???]. In [???] [???] 1578 [???] gregory martin 
began the work of preparing an english translation of the bible for 
[???]lic [???] [???] the first such translation into modern english.
assisting were william [???] [???] richard [???] [???] thomas [???] [???] and 
william [???]ds who [???] [???] [???] [???] and [???]ected dr. Martin's 
work. The [???]ge [???]ished the new testament at [???]ms ([???] [???] [???]) [???] 
france [???] in 1582 through john [???]ny with a preface and [???]atory notes [???] 
authored chiefly by [???] [???] [???] [???] and [???]. Later the old 
testament was [???]ished at douay in two parts (1609 and 1610) by laurence
[???]am through the [???]ts of dr. [???] [???] then superior of the 
[???]. The translation had been prepared before the appearance of the 
new [???] [???] but the publication was delayed due to [???]ial
[???]. The religious and scholarly [???]erence to the latin vulgate
text led to the less [???]ant and [???]atic words and phrases often found 
in the [???]. In some instances where no english word conveyed the 
full meaning of the [???] [???] a latin word was [???]ized and its meaning 
defined in a [???]. Although ridiculed by [???] [???] many of these 
words later found common usage in the english language. [???]lings of 
proper names and the numbering of the [???]ms are adopted from the latin
[???].
 
In 1749 dr. Richard [???]ner began a major revision of the douay and 
[???]ms [???] [???] the [???]lings and phrasing of which had become [???]ingly
[???]ic in the almost two [???]ries since the translations were first 
produced. He [???]ized the diction and introduced a more [???]id style [???] 
while faithfully [???]ining the accuracy of dr. Martin's [???]. This 
revision became the'de [???]'standard text for english speaking 
[???]ics until the twentieth century. It is still highly regarded by 
many for its style [???] although it is now rarely used for [???]ical
purposes. The notes included in this [???]ronic edition are generally 
attributed to bishop [???].

The book of [???]is
 
This book is so called from its treating of the generation [???] that is [???] 
of the creation and the beginning of the world. The [???]ws call it 
[???] [???] from the word with which it begins. It contains not only 
the history of the creation of the world; but also an account of its 
progress during the space of 2369 years [???] that is [???] until the death of 
joseph.
 
 
[???]is chapter 1
 
God createth heaven and earth [???] and all things therein [???] in six days.
 
1:1. In the beginning god created heaven [???] and earth.
 
1:2. And the earth was void and empty [???] and darkness was upon the face of 
the deep; and the spirit of god moved over the waters.
 
1:3. And god said: be light made. And light was made.
 
1:4. And god saw the light that it was good; and he divided the light 
from the darkness.
 
1:5. And he called the light day [???] and the darkness night; and there was 
evening and morning one day.
 
1:6. And god said: let there be a firmament made [???]st the waters: and 
let it divide the waters from the waters.
 
A [???]... By this name is here understood the whole space between 
the earth [???] and the highest stars. The lower part of which [???]eth the 
waters that are upon the earth [???] from those that are above in the clouds.
 
1:7. And god made a [???] [???] and divided the waters that were under 
the [???] [???] from those that were above the [???] [???] and it was so.
 
1:8. And god called the [???] [???] heaven; and the evening and morning 
were the second day.
 
1:9. God also said; let the waters that are under the heaven [???] be 
[???]ered together into one place: and let the dry land appear. And it 
was so done.
 
1:10. And god called the dry land [???] earth; and the [???]ering together of 
the waters [???] he called seas. And god saw that it was good.
 
1:11. And he said: let the earth bring forth green herb [???] and such as may 
seed [???] and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind [???] which may have 
seed in itself upon the earth. And it was so done.
 
1:12. And the earth brought forth the green herb [???] and such as yieldeth
seed according to its kind [???] and the tree that beareth fruit [???] having seed 
each one according to its kind. And god saw that it was good.
 
1:13. And the evening and the morning were the third day.
 
1:14. And god said: let there be lights made in the firmament of heaven [???] 
to divide the day and the night [???] and let them be for signs [???] and for 
seasons [???] and for days and years:
 
1:15. To shine in the firmament of heaven [???] and to give light upon the 
earth [???] and it was so done.
 
1:16. And god made two great lights: a greater light to rule the day;
and a lesser light to rule the night: and the stars.
 
Two great lights... God created on the first day [???] light [???] which being 
moved from east to west [???] by its rising and setting [???] made morning and 
evening. But on the fourth day he ordered and distributed this light [???] 
and made the sun [???] moon [???] and stars. The moon [???] though much less than the 
stars [???] is here called a great light [???] from its giving a far greater light 
to the earth than any of them.
 
1:17. And he set them in the firmament of heaven to shine upon the 
earth.
 
1:18. And to rule the day and the night [???] and to divide the light and the 
darkness. And god saw that it was good.
 
1:19. And the evening and morning were the fourth day.
 
1:20. God also said: let the waters bring forth the [???]ping creature 
having life [???] and the fowl that may fly over the earth under the 
firmament of heaven.
 
1:21. And god created the great [???] [???] and every living and moving 
creature [???] which the waters brought forth [???] according to their kinds [???] and 
every winged fowl according to its kind. And god saw that it was good.
 
1:22. And he blessed them [???] saying: increase and [???] [???] and fill the 
waters of the sea: and let the birds be [???]lied upon the earth.
 
1:23. And the evening and morning were the fifth day.
 
1:24. And god said: let the earth bring forth the living creature in its 
kind [???] cattle and [???]ping things [???] and beasts of the earth [???] according to 
their kinds. And it was so done.
 
1:25. And god made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds [???] and 
cattle [???] and every thing that creepeth on the earth after its kind. And 
god saw that it was good.
 
1:26. And he said: let us make man to our image and likeness: and let 
him have dominion over the fishes of the sea [???] and the fowls of the air [???] 
and the beasts [???] and the whole earth [???] and every [???]ping creature that 
moveth upon the earth.
 
Let us make man to our image... This image of god in man [???] is not in the 
body [???] but in the soul; which is a spiritual substance [???] endued with 
understanding and free will. God speaketh here in the plural number [???] to 
insinuate the [???]ality of persons in the [???].
 
1:27. And god created man to his own image: to the image of god he 
created him: male and female he created them.
 
1:28. And god blessed them [???] saying: increase and [???] [???] and fill the 
earth [???] and subdue it [???] and rule over the fishes of the sea [???] and the fowls
of the air [???] and all living creatures that move upon the earth.
 
Increase and [???]... This is not a [???] [???] as some protestant
[???]ists would have it [???] but a blessing [???] rendering them fruitful;
for god had said the same words to the [???] [???] and birds [???] (ver. 22) who 
were incapable of receiving a [???].
 
1:29. And god said: behold i have given you every herb bearing seed upon 
the earth [???] and all trees that have in themselves seed of their own kind [???] 
to be your meat:
 
1:30. And to all beasts of the earth [???] and to every fowl of the air [???] and 
to all that move upon the earth [???] and wherein there is life [???] that they 
may have to feed upon. And it was so done.
 
1:31. And god saw all the things that he had made [???] and they were very 
good. And the evening and morning were the sixth day.
 
[???]is chapter 2
 
God resteth on the seventh day and blesseth it. The earthly paradise [???] in 
which god placeth man. He commandeth him not to eat of the tree of 
knowledge. And formeth a woman of his rib.
 
2:1. So the heavens and the earth were finished [???] and all the furniture 
of them.
 
2:2. And on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made: and he 
rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.
 
He [???] [???] etc... That is [???] he ceased to make or create any new kinds of 
things. Though [???] as our lord tells us [???] john 5. 17 [???] [???]he he still [???] [???] [???] 
viz. [???] by [???]ving and [???]ning all things [???] and creating souls.
 
2:3. And he blessed the seventh day [???] and sanctified it: because in it he 
had rested from all his work which god created and made.
 
2:4. These are the generations of the heaven and the earth [???] when they 
were created [???] in the day that the lord god made the heaven and the 
earth:
 
2:5. And every plant of the field before it sprung up in the earth [???] and 
every herb of the ground before it grew: for the lord god had not rained
upon the earth; and there was not a man to till the earth.
 
2:6. But a spring rose out of the earth [???] watering all the surface of the 
earth.
 
2:7. And the lord god formed man of the slime of the earth: and breathed 
into his face the breath of life [???] and man became a living soul.
 
2:8. And the lord god had planted a paradise of pleasure from the 
beginning: wherein he placed man whom he had formed.
 
2:9. And the lord god brought forth of the ground all manner of trees [???] 
fair to behold [???] and pleasant to eat of: the tree of life also in the 
midst of paradise: and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
 
The tree of life... So called because it had that quality [???] that by 
eating of the fruit of it [???] man would have been preserved in a constant 
state of health [???] vigour [???] and strength [???] and would not have died at all.
the tree of knowledge... To which the deceitful serpent falsely 
attributed the power of [???]ting a superior kind of knowledge [???] beyond 
that which god was pleased to give.
 
2:10. And a river went out of the place of pleasure to water paradise [???] 
which from thence is divided into four heads.
 
2:11. The name of the one is [???]: that is it which compasseth all the 
land of [???] [???] where gold [???].
 
2:12. And the gold of that land is very good: there is found [???] [???] 
and the [???]x stone.
 
2:13. And the name of the second river is [???]: the same is it that 
compasseth all the land of [???].
 
2:14. And the name of the third river is [???]: the same passeth along 
by the [???]. And the fourth river is [???].
 
2:15. And the lord god took man [???] and put him into the paradise of 
pleasure [???] to dress it [???] and to keep it.
 
2:16. And he commanded him [???] saying: of every tree of paradise thou shalt 
eat:
 
2:17. But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil [???] thou shalt not eat.
for in what daysoever thou shalt eat of it [???] thou shalt die the death.
 
2:18. And the lord god said: it is not good for man to be alone: let us 
make him a help like unto himself.
 
2:19. And the lord god having formed out of the ground all the beasts of 
the earth [???] and all the fowls of the air [???] brought them to adam to see 
what he would call them: for whatsoever adam called any living creature 
the same is its name.
 
2:20. And adam called all the beasts by their names [???] and all the fowls
of the air [???] and all the cattle of the field: but for adam there was not 
found a helper like himself.
 
2:21. Then the lord god cast a deep sleep upon adam: and when he was 
fast asleep [???] he took one of his ribs [???] and filled up flesh for it.
 
2:22. And the lord god built the rib which he took from adam into a 
woman: and brought her to adam.
 
2:23. And adam said: this now is bone of my bones [???] and flesh of my 
flesh; she shall be called woman [???] because she was taken out of man.
 
2:24. Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother [???] and shall cleave to 
his wife: and they shall be two in one flesh.
 
2:25. And they were both naked: to wit [???] adam and his wife: and were not 
ashamed.
 
[???]is chapter 3
 
The serpent's craft. The fall of our first parents. Their punishment.
the promise of a [???].
 
3:1. Now the serpent was more subtle than any of the beasts of the earth 
which the lord god had made. And he said to the woman: why hath god 
commanded you [???] that you should not eat of every tree of paradise?
 
3:2. And the woman answered him [???] saying: of the fruit of the trees that 
are in paradise we do eat:
 
3:3. But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of paradise [???] god 
hath commanded us that we should not eat; and that we should not touch 
it [???] lest perhaps we die.
 
3:4. And the serpent said to the woman: no [???] you shall not die the death.
 
3:5. For god doth know that in what daysoever you shall eat thereof [???] 
your eyes shall be opened: and you shall be as gods [???] knowing good and 
evil.
 
3:6. And the woman saw that the tree was good to eat [???] and fair to the 
eyes [???] and delightful to behold: and she took of the fruit thereof [???] and 
did eat [???] and gave to her husband [???] who did eat.
 
3:7. And the eyes of them both were opened: and when they perceived 
themselves to be naked [???] they sewed together fig leaves [???] and made 
themselves [???].
 
And the eyes [???] etc... Not that they were blind before [???] (for the woman saw 
that the tree was fair to the eyes [???] ver. 6.) nor yet that their eyes 
were opened to any more perfect knowledge of good; but only to the 
unhappy experience of having lost the good of original grace and 
innocence [???] and incurred the dreadful evil of sin. From whence followed a 
shame of their being naked; which they minded not before; because being 
now stript of original grace [???] they quickly began to be subject to the 
shameful rebellions of the flesh.
 
3:8. And when they heard the voice of the lord god walking in paradise 
at the afternoon air [???] adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of 
the lord god [???] [???]st the trees of paradise.
 
3:9. And the lord god called adam [???] and said to him: where art thou?
 
3:10. And he said: i heard thy voice in paradise; and i was afraid [???] 
because i was naked [???] and i hid myself.
 
3:11. And he said to him: and who hath told thee that thou wast naked [???] 
but that thou hast eaten of the tree whereof i commanded thee that thou 
shouldst not eat?
 
3:12. And adam said: the woman [???] whom thou gavest me to be my companion [???] 
gave me of the tree [???] and i did eat.
 
3:13. And the lord god said to the woman: why hast thou done this? and 
she answered: the serpent deceived me [???] and i did eat.
 
3:14. And the lord god said to the serpent: because thou hast done this 
thing [???] thou art cursed among all cattle [???] and beasts of the earth: upon 
thy breast shalt thou go [???] and earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy 
life.
 
3:15. I will put enmities between thee and the woman [???] and thy seed and 
her seed: she shall crush thy head [???] and thou shalt lie in wait for her 
heel.
 
She shall crush... [???] [???] the woman; so divers of the fathers read this 
place [???] [???]ably to the [???]: others read it [???] [???] viz. [???] the seed.
the sense is the same: for it is by her seed [???] jesus christ [???] that the 
woman crushes the serpent's head.
 
3:16. To the woman also he said: i will [???]ly thy sorrows [???] and thy 
[???]: in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children [???] and thou shalt 
be under thy husband's power [???] and he shall have dominion over thee.
 
3:17. And to adam he said: because thou hast [???]ened to the voice of 
thy wife [???] and hast eaten of the tree [???] whereof i commanded thee [???] that 
thou shouldst not eat [???] cursed is the earth in thy work: with labour and 
toil shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy life.
 
3:18. Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee [???] and thou shalt 
eat the herbs of the earth.
 
3:19. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to 
the earth out of which thou wast taken: for dust thou art [???] and into dust 
thou shalt return.
 
3:20. And adam called the name of his wife eve: because she was the 
mother of all the living.
 
3:21. And the lord god made for adam and his wife garments of [???] [???] and 
clothed them.
 
3:22. And he said: behold adam is become as one of us [???] knowing good and 
evil: now therefore lest perhaps he put forth his hand and take also of 
the tree of life [???] and eat [???] and live for ever.
 
Behold adam [???] etc... This was spoken by way of [???]ching him with his 
pride [???] in [???]ting a knowledge that might make him like to god.
 
3:23. And the lord god sent him out of the paradise of pleasure [???] to till 
the earth from which he was taken.
 
3:24. And he cast out adam: and placed before the paradise of pleasure 
[???] [???] and a flaming sword [???] turning every way [???] to keep the way of 
the tree of life.
 
[???]is chapter 4
 
The history of cain and [???].
 
4:1. And adam knew eve his wife; who conceived and brought forth [???] [???] 
saying: i have gotten a man through god.
 
4:2. And again she brought forth his brother [???]. Andabel was a 
shepherd [???] and cain a [???].
 
4:3. And it came to pass after many days [???] that cain offered [???] of the 
fruits of the earth [???] gifts to the lord.
 
4:4.@@abel also offered of the firstlings of his flock [???] and of their fat:
and the lord had respect to [???] [???] and to his [???].
 
Had respect... That is [???] [???]ed his acceptance of his sacrifice (as 
coming from a heart full of devotion): and that [???] as we may suppose [???] by 
some visible token [???] such as sending fire from heaven upon his [???].
 
4:5. But to cain and his offerings he had no respect: and cain was 
exceeding angry [???] and his countenance fell.
 
4:6. And the lord said to him: why art thou angry? and why is thy 
countenance fallen?
 
4:7. If thou do well [???] shalt thou not receive? but if ill [???] shall not sin 
forthwith be present at the door? but the lust thereof shall be under 
thee [???] and thou shalt have dominion over it.
 
4:8. And cain said toabel his brother: let us go forth abroad. And when 
they were in the field [???] cain rose up against his brother [???] [???] and slew 
him.
 
4:9. And the lord said to [???]: where is thy brother [???]? and he 
answered: i know not: am i my brother's keeper?
 
4:10. And he said to him: what hast thou done? the voice of thy 
brother's blood crieth to me from the earth.
 
4:11. Now therefore cursed shalt thou be upon the earth [???] which hath 
opened her mouth and received the blood of thy brother at thy hand.
 
4:12. When thou shalt till it [???] it shall not yield to thee its fruit: a 
[???]itive and a [???]ond shalt thou be upon the earth.
 
4:13. And cain said to the lord: my iniquity is greater than that i may 
deserve pardon.
 
4:14. Behold thou dost cast me out this day from the face of the earth [???] 
and from thy face i shall be hid [???] and i shall be a [???]ond and a 
[???]itive on the earth: every one therefore that findeth me [???] shall kill 
me.
 
Every one that findeth me shall kill me... His guilty conscience made 
him fear his own brothers and [???]; of whom [???] by this time [???] there might 
be a good number upon the earth; which had now endured near 130 years;
as may be [???]ered from gen. 5. 3[???] compared with chap. 4. 25 [???] though in 
the [???]ious account given in the [???] [???] only cain andabel are 
mentioned.
 
4:15. And the lord said to him: no [???] it shall not so be: but whosoever
shall kill [???] [???] shall be punished [???]. And the lord set a mark 
upon [???] [???] that whosoever found him should not kill him.
 
Set a mark [???] etc... The more common opinion of the interpreters of holy 
writ supposes this mark to have been a trembling of the body; or a 
horror and [???]ation in his countenance.
 
4:16. And cain went out from the face of the lord [???] and dwelt as a 
[???]itive on the earth at the east side of [???].
 
4:17. And cain knew his wife [???] and she [???] [???] and brought forth 
[???]: and he built a city [???] and called the name thereof by the name of 
his son [???].
 
His wife... She was a daughter of adam [???] and [???]s's own sister; god 
[???]sing with such marriages in the beginning of the world [???] as mankind 
could not otherwise be [???]. He built a city [???] viz... In process of 
time [???] when his race was [???] [???] so as to be [???]erous enough to 
people it. For in the many hundred years he lived [???] his race might be 
[???]lied even to millions.

[???]is chapter 6
 
Man's sin is the cause of the [???]. Noe is commanded to build the [???].
 
6:1. And after that men began to be [???]lied upon the earth [???] and 
daughters were born to them [???] 
 
6:2. The sons of god seeing the daughters of men [???] that they were fair [???] 
took to themselves wives of all which they chose.
 
The sons of god... The descendants of seth and enos are here called sons 
of god from their religion and [???]: whereas the [???]ly race of [???] [???] 
who by their [???]al affections lay grovelling upon the earth [???] are called 
the children of men. The unhappy consequence of the former [???]ying with 
the latter [???] ought to be a warning to christians to be very [???]pect
in their [???]; and not to suffer themselves to be determined in 
their choice by their [???]al passion [???] to the [???]ice of virtue or 
religion.
 
6:3. And god said: my spirit shall not remain in man for ever [???] because 
he is flesh [???] and his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.
 
His days shall be [???] etc... The meaning is [???] that man's days [???] which before 
the flood were usually 900 years [???] should now be reduced to 120 years. Or 
rather [???] that god would allow men this term of 120 years [???] for their 
repentance and [???] [???] before he would send the [???].
 
6:4. Now giants were upon the earth in those days. For after the sons of 
god went in to the daughters of men [???] and they brought forth children [???] 
these are the mighty men of old [???] men of renown.
 
[???]... It is likely the generality of men before the flood were of a 
[???]antic stature in comparison with what men now are. But these here 
spoken of are called [???] [???] as being not only tall in [???] [???] but 
violent and savage in their [???] [???] and mere monsters of cruelty 
and lust.
 
6:5. And god seeing that the wickedness of men was great on the earth [???] 
and that all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil at all times [???] 
 
6:6. It repented him that he had made man on the earth. And being 
touched inwardly with sorrow of heart [???] 
 
It repented him [???] etc... God [???] who is [???] [???] is not capable of 
[???] [???] grief [???] or any other passion. But these expressions are used 
to declare the enormity of the sins of men [???] which was so provoking as to 
determine their creator to destroy these his creatures [???] whom before he 
had so much favoured.
 
6:7. He said: i will destroy man [???] whom i have created [???] from the face of 
the earth [???] from man even to beasts [???] from the [???]ping thing even to the 
fowls of the air [???] for it repenteth me that i have made them.
 
6:8. But noe found grace before the lord.
 
6:9. These are the generations of [???]: noe was a just and perfect man in 
his [???] [???] he walked with god.
 
6:10. And he begot three sons [???] [???] [???] cham [???] and [???].
 
6:11. And the earth was corrupted before god [???] and was filled with 
iniquity.
 
6:12. And when god had seen that the earth was corrupted (for all flesh 
had corrupted its way upon the earth) [???] 
 
6:13. He said to [???]: the end of all flesh is come before me [???] the earth 
is filled with iniquity through them [???] and i will destroy them with the 
earth.
 
6:14. Make thee anark of timber [???]: thou shalt make little rooms in 
the [???] [???] and thou shalt pitch it within and without.
 
6:15. And thus shalt thou make it. The length of theark shall be three 
hundred [???]: the breadth of it fifty [???] [???] and the height of it 
thirty [???].
 
Three hundred [???] [???] etc... The [???] [???] according to the [???]ions here 
set down [???] contained four hundred and fifty thousand square [???]; which 
was more than enough to contain all the kinds of living creatures [???] with 
all necessary [???]: even supposing the cubits here spoken of to 
have been only a foot and a half each [???] which was the least king of 
[???].
 
6:16. Thou shalt make a window in the [???] [???] and in a cubit shalt thou 
finish the top of it: and the door of theark thou shalt set in the 
side: with lower [???] middle chambers [???] and third stories shalt thou make it.
 
6:17. Behold [???] i will bring the waters of a great flood upon the earth [???] 
to destroy all flesh [???] wherein is the breath of life under heaven. All 
things that are in the earth shall be [???].
 
6:18. And i will establish my [???]ant with thee [???] and thou shalt enter 
into the [???] [???] thou and thy sons [???] and thy wife [???] and the wives of thy sons 
with thee.
 
6:19. And of every living creature of all flesh [???] thou shalt bring two of 
a sort into the [???] [???] that they may live with thee: of the male sex [???] and 
the female.
 
6:20. Of fowls according to their kind [???] and of beasts in their kind [???] and 
of every thing that creepeth on the earth according to its kind: two of 
every sort shall go in with thee [???] that they may live.
 
6:21. Thou shalt take unto thee of all food that may be eaten [???] and thou 
shalt lay it up with thee: and it shall be food for thee and them.
 
6:22. And noe did all things which god commanded him.
 
[???]is chapter 7
 
Noe with his family go into the [???]. The [???]ge [???]ows the earth.
 
7:1. And the lord said to him: go in [???] thou and all thy house [???] into the 
[???]: for thee i have seen just before me in this generation.
 
7:2. Of all clean beasts take seven and seven [???] the male and the female.
 
Of all clean... The [???]ion of clean and unclean beasts appears to 
have been made before the law of [???] [???] which was not [???]ated till 
the year of the world 2514.
 
7:3. But of the beasts that are unclean two and two [???] the male and the 
female. Of the fowls also of the air seven and seven [???] the male and the 
female: that seed may be saved upon the face of the whole earth.
 
7:4. For yet a while [???] and after seven days [???] i will rain upon the earth 
forty days and forty nights: and i will destroy every substance that i 
have made [???] from the face of the earth.
 
7:5. And noe did all things which the lord had commanded him.
 
7:6. And he was six hundred years old [???] when the waters of the flood 
[???]owed the earth.
 
7:7. And noe went in and his sons [???] his wife and the wives of his sons 
with him into the [???] [???] because of the waters of the flood.
 
7:8. And of beasts clean and unclean [???] and of [???] [???] and of every thing 
that moveth upon the earth [???] 
 
7:9. Two and two went in to noe into the [???] [???] male and female [???] as the 
lord had commanded [???].
 
7:10. And after the seven days were passed [???] the waters of the flood 
[???]owed the earth.
 
7:11. In the six hundredth year of the life of [???] [???] in the second month [???] 
in the [???]th day of the month [???] all the fountains of the great deep 
were broken up [???] and the [???]ates of heaven were opened:
 
7:12. And the rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
 
7:13. In the [???]ame day [???] [???] and [???] [???] and cham [???] and [???] [???] his sons:
his wife [???] and the three wives of his sons with them [???] went into the [???].
 
7:14. They and every beast according to its kind [???] and all the cattle in 
their kind [???] and every thing that moveth upon the earth [???] according to its 
kind [???] and every fowl according to its kind [???] all birds [???] and all that fly [???] 
 
7:15. Went in to noe into the [???] [???] two and two of all flesh [???] wherein was 
the breath of life.
 
7:16. And they that went in [???] went in male and female of all flesh [???] as 
god had commanded him: and the lord shut him in on the outside.
 
7:17. And the flood was forty days upon the earth: and the waters 
[???] [???] and lifted up theark on high from the earth.
 
7:18. For they [???]owed exceedingly: and filled all on the face of the 
earth: and theark was carried upon the waters.
 
7:19. And the waters [???]iled beyond measure upon the earth: and all 
the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered.
 
7:20. The water was fifteen cubits higher than the mountains which it 
covered.
 
7:21. And all flesh was destroyed that moved upon the earth [???] both of 
fowl and of cattle [???] and of beasts [???] and of all [???]ping things that creep 
upon the earth: and all men.
 
7:22. And all things wherein there is the breath of life on the earth [???] 
died.
 
7:23. And he destroyed all the substance that was upon the earth [???] from 
man even to beast [???] and the [???]ping things and fowls of the air: and 
they were destroyed from the earth: and noe only remained [???] and they that 
were with him in the [???].
 
7:24. And the waters [???]iled upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.
 
[???]is chapter 8
 
The [???]ge [???]. Noe goeth out of the [???] [???] and offereth a sacrifice.
god's [???]ant to him.
 
8:1. And god remembered [???] [???] and all the living creatures [???] and all the 
cattle which were with him in the [???] [???] and brought a wind upon the 
earth [???] and the waters were [???]:
 
8:2. The fountains also of the deep [???] and the [???]ates of heaven [???] were 
shut up [???] and the rain from heaven was [???].
 
8:3. And the waters returned from off the earth going and coming: and 
they began to be abated after a hundred and fifty days.
 
8:4. And theark rested in the seventh month [???] the seven and twentieth 
day of the month [???] upon the mountains of [???].
 
8:5. And the waters were going and [???]asing until the tenth month: for 
in the tenth month [???] the first day of the month [???] the tops of the 
mountains appeared.
 
8:6. And after that forty days were passed [???] noe opening the window of 
the [???] [???] which he had made [???] sent forth a raven:
 
8:7. Which went forth and did not return [???] till the waters were dried up 
upon the earth.
 
Did not return... The raven did not return into the [???]; but (as it may 
be [???]ered from the [???]) went to and fro; sometimes going to the 
mountains [???] where it found [???]sses to feed on: and other times 
returning [???] to rest upon the top of the [???].
 
8:8. He sent forth also a dove after him [???] to see if the waters had now 
ceased upon the face of the earth.
 
8:9. But she not finding where her foot might rest [???] returned to him into 
the [???]: for the waters were upon the whole earth: and he put forth his 
hand [???] and caught her [???] and brought her into the [???].
 
8:10. And having waited yet seven other days [???] he again sent forth the 
dove out of the [???].
 
8:11. And she came to him in the evening carrying a bough of an [???]ive
tree [???] with green leaves [???] in her mouth. Noe therefore understood that the 
waters were ceased upon the earth.
 
8:12. And he stayed yet other seven days: and he sent forth the dove [???] 
which returned not any more unto him.
 
8:13. Therefore in the six hundredth and first year [???] the first month [???] 
the first day of the month [???] the waters were lessened upon the earth [???] and 
noe opening the covering of the [???] [???] looked [???] and saw that the face of 
the earth was dried.
 
8:14. In the second month [???] the seven and twentieth day of the month [???] the 
earth was dried.
 
8:15. And god spoke to [???] [???] saying:
 
8:16. Go out of the [???] [???] thou and thy wife [???] thy sons and the wives of 
thy sons with thee.
 
8:17. All living things that are with thee of all flesh [???] as well in 
fowls as in beasts [???] and all [???]ping things that creep upon the earth [???] 
bring out with thee [???] and go ye upon the earth: increase and [???]ly
upon it.
 
8:18. So noe went out [???] he and his sons: his wife [???] and the wives of his 
sons with him.

fowls that were clean [???] offered [???]ts upon the altar.
 
[???] [???]... Or whole burnt [???]. In which the whole victim was 
consumed by fire upon god's altar [???] and no part was reserved for the use 
of priest or people.
 
8:21. And the lord [???]lled a sweet savour [???] and said: i will no more 
curse the earth for the sake of man: for the imagination and thought of 
man's heart are prone to evil from his youth: therefore i will no more 
destroy every living soul as i have done.
 
[???] [???] etc... A [???]ative expression [???] [???]ting that god was well 
pleased with the sacrifices which his servant offered.
 
8:22. All the days of the earth [???] [???]ime and harvest [???] cold and heat [???] 
summer and winter [???] night and day [???] shall not cease.

God [???]eth [???]: [???]eth blood [???] and promiseth never more to destroy 
the world by water. The blessing of sem and [???].
 
9:1. And god blessed noe and his sons. And he said to them: increase [???] 
and [???] [???] and fill the earth.
 
9:2. And let the fear and dread of you be upon all the beasts of the 
earth [???] and upon all the fowls of the air [???] and all that move upon the 
earth: all the fishes of the sea are delivered into your hand.
 
9:3. And every thing that [???] [???] and liveth shall be meat for you: even 
as the green herbs have i delivered them all to you:
 
9:4. Saving that flesh with blood you shall not eat.
 
9:5. For i will require the blood of your lives at the hand of every 
beast [???] and at the hand of man [???] at the hand of every man [???] and of his 
brother [???] will i require the life of man.
 
9:6. Whosoever shall shed man's blood [???] his blood shall be shed: for man 
was made to the image of god.
 
9:7. But increase you and [???] [???] and go upon the earth and fill it.
 
9:8. Thus also said god to [???] [???] and to his sons with him:
 
9:9. Behold i will establish my [???]ant with you [???] and with your seed 
after you:
 
9:10. And with every living soul that is with you [???] as well in all birds [???] 
as in cattle and beasts of the earth [???] that are come forth out of the 
[???] [???] and in all the beasts of the earth.
 
9:11. I will establish my [???]ant with you [???] and all flesh shall be no 
more destroyed with the waters of a flood [???] neither shall there be from 
henceforth a flood to waste the earth.
 
9:12. And god said: this is the sign of the [???]ant which i give 
between me and you [???] and to every living soul that is with you [???] for 
perpetual [???].
 
9:13. I will set my bow in the clouds [???] and it shall be the sign of a 
[???]ant between me and between the earth.
 
9:14. And when i shall cover the sky with clouds [???] my bow shall appear in 
the clouds:
 
9:15. And i will remember my [???]ant with you [???] and with every living 
soul that beareth flesh: and there shall no more be waters of a flood to 
destroy all flesh.
 
9:16. And the bow shall be in the clouds [???] and i shall see it [???] and shall 
remember the everlasting [???] [???] that was made between god and every 
living soul of all flesh which is upon the earth.
 
9:17. And god said to [???]: this shall be the sign of the [???] [???] which 
i have established [???] between me and all flesh upon the earth.
 
9:18. And the sons of [???] [???] who came out of the [???] [???] were [???] [???] cham [???] and 
[???]: and cham is the father of [???].
 
9:19. These three are the sons of [???]: and from these was all mankind 
spread over the whole earth.
 
9:20. And noe a husbandman began to till the ground [???] and planted a 
[???].
 
9:21. And drinking of the wine was made drunk [???] and was [???]ered in his 
tent.
 
Drunk... Noe by the judgment of the fathers was not guilty of sin [???] in 
being overcome by wine: because he knew not the strength of it.
 
9:22. Which when cham the father of chan had seen [???] to wit [???] that his 
father's nakedness was [???] [???] he told it to his two brethren 
without.
 
9:23. But sem and [???]eth put a cloak upon their shoulders [???] and going 
backward [???] covered the nakedness of their father: and their faces were 
turned away [???] and they saw not their father's [???].
 
Covered the [???]... Thus [???] as st. Gregory takes notice L. 35; moral.
C. 22 [???] we ought to cover the [???] [???] that is [???] the sins [???] of our 
spiritual parents and [???].
 
9:24. And noe awaking from the wine [???] when he had learned what his 
younger son had done to him [???] 
 
9:25. He said: cursed be [???] [???] a servant of servants shall he be unto 
his brethren.
 
Cursed be [???]... The curses [???] as well as the blessings [???] of the 
[???] [???] were [???]: and this in particular is here [???]ded by 
[???] [???] for the children of [???] [???] who were to possess the land of 
[???]. But why should chan be cursed for his father's faults? the 
[???]ws answer [???] that he being then a boy [???] was the first that saw his 
grandfather's [???] [???] and told his father cham of it; and joined with 
him in laughing at it: which drew upon him [???] rather than upon the rest of 
the children of cham [???] this prophetical curse.
 
9:26. And he said: blessed be the lord god of [???] [???] be chan his 
servant.
 
9:27. May god enlarge [???] [???] and may he dwell in the tents of [???] [???] and 
chan be his servant.
 
9:28. And noe lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
 
9:29. And all his days were in the whole nine hundred and fifty years:
and he died.

of men [???] but before the lord [???] that is [???] in his sight who cannot be 
deceived.
 
1 0:10. And the beginning of his kingdom was [???] [???] and [???] [???] and 
[???] [???] and [???]ne in the land of [???].
 
1 0:11. Out of that land came forth assur [???] and built [???] [???] and the 
streets of the city [???] and [???].
 
1 0:12. Resen also between ninive and [???]: this is the great city.
 
1 0:13. And [???]aim begot [???] [???] and [???]im and [???] [???] [???].
 
1 0:14. And [???] [???] and [???]; of whom came forth the [???] [???] 
and the [???].
 
1 0:15. And chan begot [???]on his [???] [???] the [???] [???] 
 
1 0:16. And the [???] [???] and the [???] [???] and the [???].
 
1 0:17. The [???]ite and [???]: the [???] [???] 
 
1 0:18. And the [???] [???] the [???] [???] and the [???]: and afterwards 
the [???]lies of the [???]ites were spread abroad.
 
1 0:19. And the limits of chan were from [???]on as one comes to gera
even to [???] [???] until thou enter sodom and [???] [???] and [???] [???] and [???]im
even to [???].
 
1 0:20. These are the children of cham in their [???]eds and tongues [???] and 
[???] [???] and lands [???] and [???].
 
1 0:21. Of sem also the father of all the children of [???] [???] the elder 
brother of [???] [???] sons were born.
 
1 0:22. The sons of [???]: elam and assur [???] and [???] [???] and [???] [???] and [???].
 
1 0:23. The sons of [???]: us [???] and [???] [???] and [???]; and [???].
 
1 0:24. But [???]ad begot sale [???] of whom was born [???].
 
1 0:25. And to heber were born two sons: the name of the one was [???] [???] 
because in his days was the earth divided: and his brother's name 
[???].
 
1 0:26. Which [???]an begot [???] [???] and [???] [???] and [???] [???] [???] [???] 
 
1 0:27. And [???] [???] and [???] [???] and [???] [???] 
 
1 0:28. And [???] [???] and [???] [???] [???] [???] 
 
1 0:29. And [???] [???] and [???] [???] and [???]. All these were the sons of 
[???].
 
1 0:30. And their dwelling was from messa as we go on as far as [???] [???] a 
mountain in the east.
 
1 0:31. These are the children of sem according to their [???]eds and 
tongues [???] and countries in their [???].
 
1 0:32. These are the [???]lies of [???] [???] according to their people and 
[???]. By these were the nations divided on the earth after the flood.
 
[???]is chapter 11
 
The tower of [???]. The confusion of tongues. The [???]gy of sem down 
to [???].
 
1 1:1. And the earth was of one tongue [???] and of the same speech.
 
1 1:2. And when they removed from the east [???] they found a plain in the 
land of [???] [???] and dwelt in it.
 
1 1:3. And each one said to his neighbour: come let us make [???] [???] and 
bake them with fire. And they had brick instead of stones [???] and slime
instead of [???]:
 
1 1:4. And they said: come [???] let us make a city and a tower [???] the top 
whereof may reach to heaven; and let us make our name famous before we 
be scattered abroad into all lands.
 
1 1:5. And the lord came down to see the city and the tower [???] which the 
children of adam were building.
 
1 1:6. And he said: behold [???] it is one people [???] and all have one tongue:
and they have begun to do this [???] neither will they leave off from their 
designs [???] till they accomplish them in deed.
 
1 1:7. Come ye [???] therefore [???] let us go down [???] and there confound their 
tongue [???] that they may not understand one another's speech.
 
1 1:8. And so the lord scattered them from that place into all lands [???] and 
they ceased to build the city.
 
1 1:9. And therefore the name thereof was called [???] [???] because there the 
language of the whole earth was confounded: and from thence the lord 
scattered them abroad upon the face of all countries.
 
[???]... That is [???] confusion.
 
1 1:10. These are the generations of [???]: sem was a hundred years old 
when he begot [???] [???] two years after the flood.
 
1 1:11. And sem lived after he begot [???] [???] five hundred years [???] and 
begot sons and daughters.
 
1 1:12. And [???]ad lived thirty-five years [???] and begot sale.
 
1 1:13. And [???]ad lived after he begot sale [???] three hundred and three 
years [???] and begot sons and daughters.
 
1 1:14. Sale also lived thirty years [???] and begot [???].
 
1 1:15. And sale lived after he begot [???] [???] four hundred and three 
years: and begot sons and daughters.
 
1 1:16. And heber lived thirty-four years [???] and begot [???].
 
1 1:17. And heber lived after he begot [???] [???] four hundred and thirty 
years: and begot sons and daughters.
 
1 1:18. [???]eg also lived thirty years [???] and begot [???].
 
1 1:19. And [???]eg lived after he begot [???] [???] two hundred and nine years [???] 
and begot sons and daughters.
 
1 1:20. And reu lived thirty-two years [???] and begot [???].
 
1 1:21. And reu lived after he begot [???] [???] two hundred and seven years [???] 
and begot sons and daughters.
 
1 1:22. And sarug lived thirty years [???] and begot [???].
 
1 1:23. And sarug lived after he begot [???] [???] two hundred years [???] and 
begot sons and daughters.
 
1 1:24. And [???]or lived nine and twenty years [???] and begot [???].
 
1 1:25. And [???]or lived after he begot [???] [???] a hundred and nineteen 
years [???] and begot sons and daughters.
 
1 1:26. And thare lived [???]enty years [???] and begot [???] [???] and [???] [???] and 
[???].
 
1 1:27. And these are the generations of [???]: thare begot [???] [???] 
[???] [???] and [???]. And aran begot lot.
 
1 1:28. And aran died before thare his father [???] in the land of his 
nativity in ur of the [???].
 
1 1:29. And abram and [???]or married wives: the name of [???]s's wife was 
[???]: and the name of [???]s's wife [???] [???] [???] the daughter of [???] [???] 
father of [???]a and father of [???].
 
1 1:30. And [???]i was barren [???] and had no children.
 
1 1:31. And thare took abram his son [???] and lot the son of [???] [???] his son's 
son [???] and [???]i his daughter-in-law [???] the wife of abram his son [???] and 
brought them out of ur of the [???] [???] to go into the land of [???]:
and they came as far as [???] [???] and dwelt there.
 
1 1:32. And the days of thare were two hundred and five years [???] and he 
died in [???].
 
[???]is chapter 12
 
The call of [???] [???] and the promise made to him. He [???]eth in 
[???] [???] and then by occasion of a [???] [???] goeth down to egypt.
 
1 2:1. And the lord said to [???]: go forth out of thy country [???] and from 
thy kindred [???] and out of thy father's house [???] and come into the land which 
i shall shew thee.
 
1 2:2. And i will make of thee a great nation [???] and i will bless thee [???] and 
magnify thy name [???] and thou shalt be blessed.
 
1 2:3. I will bless them that bless thee [???] and curse them that curse thee [???] 
and in thee shall all the [???]eds of the earth be blessed.
 
1 2:4. So abram went out as the lord had commanded him [???] and lot went with 
him: abram was [???]ive-five years old when he went forth from [???].
 
1 2:5. And he took [???]i his wife [???] and lot his brother's son [???] and all the 
substance which they had [???] [???] and the souls which they had gotten
in [???]: and they went out to go into the land of [???]. And when 
they were come into it [???] 
 
1 2:6. Abram passed through the country unto the place of [???] [???] as far 
as the noble [???]: now the [???]ite was at that time in the land.
 
1 2:7. And the lord appeared to [???] [???] and said to him: to thy seed will 
i give this land. And he built there an altar to the lord [???] who had 
appeared to him.
 
1 2:8. And passing on from thence to a mountain [???] that was on the east 
side of [???] [???] he there pitched his tent [???] having [???]el on the west [???] 
and hai on the east: he built there also an altar to the lord [???] and 
called upon his name.
 
1 2:9. And abram went forward [???] going and proceeding on to the south.
 
1 2:10. And there came a famine in the country: and abram went down into 
egypt [???] to [???]urn there: for the famine was very grievous in the land.
 
1 2:11. And when he was near to enter into egypt [???] he said to [???]i his 
wife: i know that thou art a beautiful woman:
 
1 2:12. And that when the egyptians shall see thee [???] they will say: she is 
his wife: and they will kill me [???] and keep thee.
 
1 2:13. Say [???] therefore [???] i pray thee [???] that thou art my sister: that i may 
be well used for thee [???] and that my soul may live for thy sake.
 
My sister... This was no lie; because she was his niece [???] being daughter 
to his brother [???] [???] and therefore [???] in the style of the [???] [???] she 
might truly be called his sister [???] as lot is called [???]s's brother [???] gen.
14. 14. See gen. 20. 12.
 
1 2:14. And when abram was come into egypt [???] the egyptians saw the woman 
that she was very beautiful.
 
1 2:15. And the princes told [???] [???] and praised her before him: and the 
woman was taken into the house of [???].
 
1 2:16. And they used abram well for her sake. And he had sheep and oxen
and he-[???] [???] and men servants [???] and maid servants [???] and she-[???] [???] and 
[???].
 
1 2:17. But the lord scourged [???]o and his house with most grievous 
stripes for [???] [???] [???]s's wife.
 
1 2:18. And [???]o called [???] [???] and said to him: what is this that thou 
hast done to me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
 
1 2:19. For what cause didst thou say [???] she was thy sister [???] that i might 
take her to my wife? now therefore there is thy wife [???] take her [???] and go 
thy way.
 
1 2:20. And [???]o gave his men orders concerning [???]: and they led him 
away and his wife [???] and all that he had.
 
[???]is chapter 13
 
Abram and lot part from each other. God's promise to [???].
 
1 3:1. And abram went up out of egypt [???] he and his wife [???] and all that he 
had [???] and lot with him into the south.
 
1 3:2. And he was very rich in possession of gold and silver.
 
1 3:3. And he returned by the way [???] that he came [???] from the south to 
[???] [???] to the place where before he had pitched his tent between [???]el
and [???] [???] 
 
1 3:4. In the place of the altar which he had made before [???] and there he 
called upon the name of the lord.
 
1 3:5. But lot also [???] who was with [???] [???] had flocks of sheep [???] and herds
of beasts [???] and tents.
 
1 3:6. Neither was the land able to bear them [???] that they might dwell 
together: for their substance was great [???] and they could not dwell 
together.
 
1 3:7. Whereupon also there arose a strife between the [???]men of abram
and of lot. And at that time the [???]ite and the [???]ite [???]lled in 
that country.
 
1 3:8. Abram therefore said to lot: let there be no quarrel [???] i beseech 
thee [???] between me and thee [???] and between my [???]men and thy [???]: for 
we are brethren.
 
1 3:9. Behold the whole land is before thee: depart from me [???] i pray thee:
if thou wilt go to the left hand [???] i will take the right: if thou choose 
the right hand [???] i will pass to the left.
 
1 3:10. And lot [???]ting up his eyes [???] saw all the country about the 
[???] [???] which was watered throughout [???] before the lord destroyed sodom
and [???] [???] as the paradise of the lord [???] and like egypt as one comes 
to [???].
 
1 3:11. And lot chose to himself the country about the [???] [???] and he 
departed from the east: and they were separated one brother from the 
other.
 
1 3:12. Abram dwelt in the land of [???]: and lot [???]de in the towns [???] 
that were about the [???] [???] and dwelt in [???].
 
1 3:13. And the men of sodom were very wicked [???] and sinners before the 
face of the lord beyond measure.
 
1 3:14. And the lord said to [???] [???] after lot was separated from him:
lift up thy eyes [???] and look from the place wherein thou now art [???] to the 
north and to the south [???] to the east and to the west.
 
1 3:15. All the land which thou seest [???] i will give to thee [???] and to thy 
seed for ever.
 
1 3:16. And i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: if any man be 
able to number the dust of the earth [???] he shall be able to number thy 
seed also.
 
1 3:17. Arise and walk through the land in the length [???] and the breadth
thereof: for i will give it to thee.
 
1 3:18. So abram removing his tent [???] came [???] and dwelt by the vale of 
[???] [???] which is in [???]: and he built there an altar to the lord.
 
[???]is chapter 14
 
The expedition of the four kings; the victory of [???]; he is blessed by 
[???].
 
1 4:1. And it came to pass at that time [???] that [???] [???] king of [???] [???] 
and [???] [???] king of [???] [???] and [???] [???] king of the [???] [???] and 
[???] [???] king of [???] [???] 
 
1 4:2. Made war against [???] [???] king of [???] [???] and against [???] [???] king of 
[???] [???] and against [???] [???] king of [???] [???] and against [???] [???] king 
of [???] [???] and against the king of [???] [???] which is [???].
 
1 4:3. All these came together into the woodland [???] [???] which now is the 
salt sea.
 
1 4:4. For they had served [???]mor twelve years [???] and in the 
[???]th year they revolted from him.
 
1 4:5. And in the fourteenth year came [???] [???] and the kings that 
were with him: and they smote the [???]aim in [???] [???] and the 
[???]im with them [???] and the emim in save of [???].
 
1 4:6. And the [???]ans in the mountains of [???] [???] even to the plains of 
[???] [???] which is in the wilderness.
 
1 4:7. And they returned [???] and came to the fountain of [???] [???] the same 
is [???]: and they smote all the country of the [???] [???] and the 
[???]ean that dwelt in [???].
 
1 4:8. And the king of [???] [???] and the king of [???] [???] and the king of 
[???] [???] and the king of [???] [???] and the king of [???] [???] which is [???] [???] 
went out: and they set themselves against them in battle array [???] in the 
woodland [???]:
 
1 4:9. To wit [???] against [???]mor king of the [???] [???] and [???]al
king of [???] [???] and [???]el king of [???] [???] and [???]ch king of 
[???]: four kings against five.
 
1 4:10. Now the woodland vale had many pits of [???]. And the king of 
[???] [???] and the king of [???]a turned their backs [???] and were overthrown 
there: and they that remained [???] fled to the mountain.
 
Of [???]. [???]... This was a kind of pitch [???] which served for mortar
in the building of [???] [???] gen. 11. 3[???] and was used by noe in pitching the 
[???].
 
1 4:11. And they took all the substance of the [???] [???] and 
[???] [???] and all their [???] [???] and went their way:
 
1 4:12. And lot also [???] the son of [???]s's brother [???] who dwelt in [???] [???] and 
his substance.
 
1 4:13. And behold one [???] that had escaped [???] told abram the [???] [???] who 
dwelt in the vale of [???]re the [???] [???] the brother of [???] [???] and the 
brother of [???]: for these had made a league with [???].
 
1 4:14. Which when abram had heard [???] to wit [???] that his brother lot was 
taken [???] he numbered of the servants born in his house [???] three hundred and 
[???] [???] well appointed: and pursued them to [???].
 
1 4:15. And dividing his company [???] he rushed upon them in the night [???] and 
defeated them: and pursued them as far as [???] [???] which is on the left 
hand of [???].
 
1 4:16. And he brought back all the substance [???] and lot his brother [???] with 
his substance [???] the women also [???] and the people.
 
1 4:17. And the king of sodom went out to meet him [???] after he returned 
from the slaughter of [???] [???] and of the kings that were with him 
in the vale of save [???] which is the king's [???].
 
1 4:18. But [???] [???] the king of [???] [???] bringing forth bread and 
wine [???] for he was the priest of the most high god [???] 
 
1 4:19. Blessed him [???] and said: blessed be abram by the most high god [???] who 
created heaven and earth.
 
1 4:20. And blessed be the most high god [???] by whose protection [???] the 
enemies are in thy hands. And he gave him the [???]es of all.
 
1 4:21. And the king of sodom said to [???]: give me the persons [???] and the 
rest take to thyself.
 
1 4:22. And he answered him: i lift up my hand to the lord god the most 
high [???] the possessor of heaven and earth [???] 
 
1 4:23. That from the very woof thread unto the shoe [???] [???] i will not 
take of any things that are thine [???] lest thou say: i have enriched [???].
 
1 4:24. Except such things as the young men have eaten [???] and the shares of 
the men that came with me [???] [???] [???] [???] [???] and [???]: these shall take 
their [???].
 
[???]is chapter 15
 
God promiseth seed to [???]. His faith [???] sacrifice and vision.
 
1 5:1. Now when these things were done [???] the word of the lord came to 
abram by a vision [???] saying: fear not [???] [???] [???] i am thy protector [???] and thy 
reward exceeding great.
 
1 5:2. And abram said: lord god [???] what wilt thou give me? i shall go 
without children: and the son of the steward of my house is this 
[???]cus [???].
 
1 5:3. And abram added: but to me thou hast not given seed: and lo my 
servant born in my house [???] shall be my heir.
 
1 5:4. And immediately the word of the lord came to him [???] saying: he 
shall not be thy heir: but he that shall come out of thy bowels [???] him 
shalt thou have for thy heir.
 
1 5:5. And he brought him forth abroad [???] and said to him: look up to 
heaven and number the stars if thou canst. And he said to him: so shall 
thy seed be.
 
1 5:6. Abram believed god [???] and it was reputed to him unto justice.
 
1 5:7. And he said to him: i am the lord who brought thee out from ur of 
the [???] [???] to give thee this land [???] and that thou mightest possess it.
 
1 5:8. But he said: lord god [???] whereby may i know that i shall possess it?
 
1 5:9. And the lord answered [???] and said: take me a cow of three years old [???] 
and a she-[???]at of three years [???] and a ram of three years [???] a turtle also [???] 
and a [???].
 
1 5:10. And he took all these [???] and divided them in the midst [???] and laid 
the two pieces of each one against the other: but the birds he divided 
not.
 
1 5:11. And the fowls came down upon the [???] [???] and abram drove them 
away.
 
1 5:12. And when the sun was setting [???] a deep sleep fell upon [???] [???] and a 
great and darksome horror seized upon him.
 
1 5:13. And it was said unto him: know thou beforehand that thy seed 
shall be a stranger in a land not their own [???] and they shall bring them 
under bondage [???] and afflict them four hundred years.
 
1 5:14. But i will judge the nation which they shall serve [???] and after 
this they shall come out with great substance.
 
1 5:15. And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace [???] and be buried in a 
good old age.
 
1 5:16. But in the fourth generation they shall return hither: for as yet 
the [???]ities of the [???]ites are not at the full until this present 
time.
 
1 5:17. And when the sun was set [???] there arose a dark mist [???] and there 
appeared a smoking [???] [???] and a lamp of fire passing between those 
[???].
 
1 5:18. That day god made a [???]ant with [???] [???] saying: to thy seed will 
i give this land [???] from the river to egypt even to the great river 
[???].
 
1 5:19. The [???] [???] and [???] [???] the [???] [???] 
 
1 5:20. And the [???] [???] and the [???] [???] the [???]aim also [???] 
 
1 5:21. And the [???] [???] and the [???] [???] and the [???] [???] and 
the [???].
 
[???]is chapter 16
 
Abram [???]eth [???] [???] who bringeth forth [???].
 
1 6:1. Now [???] [???] the wife of [???] [???] had brought forth no children: but 
having a [???] [???] an egyptian [???] named [???] [???] 
 
1 6:2. She said to her husband: behold [???] the lord hath restrained me from 
bearing: go in unto my [???] [???] it may be i may have children of her at 
least. And when he agreed to her request [???] 
 
1 6:3. She took agar the egyptian her [???] [???] ten years after they 
first dwelt in the land of [???] [???] and gave her to her husband to wife.
 
To wife... [???]ality of wives [???] though contrary to the primitive
institution of marriage [???] gen. 2. 24 [???] was by divine [???]ation allowed 
to the [???]: which allowance seems to have continued during the 
time of the law of [???]. But christ our lord reduced marriage to its 
primitive [???]. [???]. 19.
 
1 6:4. And he went in to her. But she perceiving that she was with child [???] 
despised her mistress.
 
1 6:5. And [???]i said to [???]: thou dost unjustly with me: i gave my 
handmaid into thy bosom [???] and she perceiving herself to be with child [???] 
despiseth me. The lord judge between me and thee.
 
1 6:6. And abram made answer [???] and said to her: behold thy handmaid is in 
thy own hand [???] use her as it pleaseth thee. And when [???]i afflicted her [???] 
she ran away.
 
1 6:7. And the angel of the lord having found her [???] by a fountain of water 
in the wilderness [???] which is in the way to sur in the desert [???] 
 
1 6:8. He said to her: [???] [???] handmaid of [???] [???] whence comest thou? and 
whither goest thou? and she answered: i flee from the face of [???] [???] my 
mistress.
 
1 6:9. And the angel of the lord said to her: return to thy mistress [???] and 
humble thyself under her hand.
 
1 6:10. And again he said: i will [???]ly thy seed exceedingly [???] and it 
shall not be numbered for multitude.
 
1 6:11. And again: behold [???] said he [???] thou art with child [???] and thou shalt 
bring forth a son: and thou shalt call his name [???] [???] because the lord 
hath heard thy affliction.
 
1 6:12. He shall be a wild man: his hand will be against all men [???] and all 
men's hands against him: and he shall pitch his tents over against all 
his brethren.
 
1 6:13. And she called the name of the lord that spoke unto her: thou the 
god who hast seen me. For she said: verily [???] here have i seen the hinder 
parts of him that seeth me.
 
1 6:14. Therefore she called that well [???] the well of him that liveth and 
seeth me. The same is between cades and [???].
 
1 6:15. And agar brought forth a son to [???]: who called his name 
[???].
 
1 6:16. Abram was four score and six years old when agar brought him 
forth [???].
 
[???]is chapter 17
 
The [???]ant of [???].
 
1 7:1. And after he began to be ninety and nine years old [???] the lord 
appeared to him: and said unto him: i am the [???]ty god: walk before 
me [???] and be perfect.
 
1 7:2. And i will make my [???]ant between me and thee: and i will 
[???]ly thee exceedingly.
 
1 7:3. Abram fell flat on his face.
 
1 7:4. And god said to him: i am [???] and my [???]ant is with thee [???] and thou 
shalt be a father of many [???].
 
1 7:5. Neither shall thy name be called any more [???]: but thou shalt be 
called [???]: because i have made thee a father of many [???].
 
[???]... In the [???] [???] signifies a high father: but [???] [???] the father 
of the multitude; [???]i signifies my lady [???] but sara absolutely lady.
 
1 7:6. And i will make thee increase exceedingly [???] and i will make nations
of thee [???] and kings shall come out of thee.
 
1 7:7. And i will establish my [???]ant between me and thee [???] and between 
thy seed after thee in their [???] [???] by a perpetual [???]: to be 
a god to thee [???] and to thy seed after thee.
 
1 7:8. And i will give to thee [???] and to thy seed [???] the land of thy 
[???] [???] all the land of [???] [???] for a perpetual possession [???] and i 
will be their god.
 
1 7:9. Again god said to [???]: and thou therefore shalt keep my 
[???] [???] and thy seed after thee in their [???].
 
1 7:10. This is my [???]ant which you shall observe between me and you [???] 
and thy seed after thee: all the male-kind of you shall be [???].
 
1 7:11. And you shall circumcise the flesh of your [???] [???] that it may 
be for a sign of the [???]ant between me and you.
 
1 7:12. An infant of eight days old shall be [???]ised among you [???] every 
[???]ild in your [???]: he that is born in the house [???] as well as 
the bought servant [???] shall be [???] [???] and whosoever is not of your 
stock:
 
1 7:13. And my [???]ant shall be in your flesh for a perpetual [???].
 
1 7:14. The male whose flesh of his foreskin shall not be [???] [???] 
that soul shall be destroyed out of his people: because he hath broken 
my [???].
 
1 7:15. God said also to [???]: [???]i thy wife thou shalt not call 
[???] [???] but [???].
 
1 7:16. And i will bless her [???] and of her i will give thee a son [???] whom i 
will bless [???] and he shall become [???] [???] and kings of people shall 
spring from him.
 
1 7:17. [???]ham fell upon his face [???] and laughed [???] saying in his heart:
shall a son [???] thinkest thou [???] be born to him that is a hundred years old?
and shall sara that is ninety years old bring forth?
 
1 7:18. And he said to god: o that [???]ael may live before thee.
 
1 7:19. And god said to [???]: sara thy wife shall bear thee a son [???] and 
thou shalt call his name [???] [???] and i will establish my [???]ant with 
him for a perpetual [???] [???] and with his seed after him.
 
1 7:20. And as for [???]ael i have also heard thee. Behold [???] i will bless 
him [???] and increase [???] and [???]ly him exceedingly: he shall beget twelve 
[???] [???] and i will make him a great nation.
 
1 7:21. But my [???]ant i will establish with [???] [???] whom sara shall 
bring forth to thee at this time in the next year.
 
1 7:22. And when he had left off speaking with him [???] god went up from 
[???].
 
1 7:23. And [???]ham took [???]ael his son [???] and all that were born in his 
house: and all whom he had bought [???] every male among the men of his 
house: and he [???]ised the flesh of their foreskin forthwith the very 
same day [???] as god had commanded him.
 
1 7:24. [???]ham was ninety and nine years old [???] when he [???]ised the 
flesh of his [???].
 
1 7:25. And [???]ael his son was full thirteen years old at the time of his 
[???].
 
1 7:26. The [???]ame day was [???]ham [???]ised and [???]ael his son.
 
1 7:27. And all the men of his house [???] as well they that were born in his 
house [???] as the bought servants and strangers [???] were [???]ised with him.
 
[???]is chapter 18
 
Angels are [???]ained by [???]. They foretell the birth of [???].
[???]s's prayer for the men of [???].
 
1 8:1. And the lord appeared to him in the vale of [???]re as he was 
sitting at the door of his tent [???] in the very heat of the day.
 
1 8:2. And when he had lifted up his eyes [???] there appeared to him three 
men standing near to him: and as soon as he saw them [???] he ran to meet 
them from the door of his tent [???] and adored down to the ground.
 
1 8:3. And he said: lord [???] if i have found favour in thy sight [???] pass not 
away from thy servant.
 
1 8:4. But i will fetch a little water [???] and wash ye your feet [???] and rest 
ye under the tree.
 
1 8:5. And i will set a morsel of bread [???] and stren ye your heart [???] 
afterwards you shall pass on: for therefore are you come aside to your 
servant. And they said: do as thou hast spoken.
 
1 8:6. [???]ham made haste into the tent to [???] [???] and said to her: make 
haste [???] temper together three measures of [???] [???] and make cakes upon the 
hearth.
 
1 8:7. And he himself ran to the herd [???] and took from thence a calf [???] very 
tender and very good [???] and gave it to a young man [???] who made haste and 
boiled it.
 
1 8:8. He took also butter and milk [???] and the calf which he had [???] [???] 
and set before them: but he stood by them under the tree.
 
1 8:9. And when they had eaten [???] they said to him: where is sara thy wife?
he answered: lo she is in the tent.
 
1 8:10. And he said to him: i will return and come to thee at this time [???] 
life [???] [???] and [???] [???] thy wife [???] shall have a son. Which when sara
heard [???] she laughed behind the door of the tent.
 
1 8:11. Now they were both old [???] and far advanced in years [???] and it had 
ceased to be with sara after the manner of women.
 
1 8:12. And she laughed secretly [???] saying: after i am grown old [???] and my 
lord is an old man [???] shall i give myself to pleasure?
 
1 8:13. And the lord said to [???]: why did sara laugh [???] saying: shall 
i [???] who am an old woman [???] bear a child indeed?
 
1 8:14. Is there any thing hard to god? according to appointment i will 
return to thee at this same time [???] life [???] [???] and sara shall have 
a son.
 
1 8:15. Sara denied [???] saying: i did not laugh: for she was afraid. But the 
lord said: nay; but thou didst laugh.
 
1 8:16. And when the men rose up from thence [???] they turned their eyes 
towards [???]: and [???]ham walked with them [???] bringing them on the way.
 
1 8:17. And the lord said: can i hide from [???]ham what i am about to do:
 
1 8:18. Seeing he shall become a great and mighty nation [???] and in him all 
the nations of the earth shall be blessed?
 
1 8:19. For i know that he will command his children [???] and his household 
after him [???] to keep the way of the lord [???] and do judgment and justice:
that for [???]s's sake [???] the lord may bring to effect all the things he 
hath spoken unto him.
 
1 8:20. And the lord said: the cry of sodom and [???]a is [???] [???] 
and their sin is become exceedingly grievous.
 
1 8:21. I will go down and see whether they have done according to the 
cry that is come to me; or whether it be not so [???] that i may know.
 
I will go down [???] etc... The lord here accommodates his discourse to the 
way of speaking and acting amongst men; for he knoweth all things [???] and 
needeth not to go anywhere for information. Note here [???] that two of the 
three angels went away immediately for [???]; whilst the third [???] who 
represented the lord [???] remained with [???].
 
1 8:22. And they turned themselves from thence [???] and went their way to 
[???]: but [???]ham as yet stood before the lord.
 
1 8:23. And drawing nigh [???] he said: wilt thou destroy the just with the 
wicked?
 
1 8:24. If there be fifty just men in the city [???] shall they perish withal?
and wilt thou not spare that place for the sake of the fifty just [???] if 
they be therein?
 
1 8:25. Far be it from thee to do this thing [???] and to slay the just with 
the wicked [???] and for the just to be in like case as the wicked; this is 
not [???]ming thee: thou who judgest all the earth [???] wilt not make this 
judgment.
 
1 8:26. And the lord said to him: if i find in sodom fifty just within 
the city [???] i will spare the whole place for their sake.
 
1 8:27. And [???]ham answered [???] and said: seeing i have once begun [???] i will 
speak to my lord [???] whereas i am dust and ashes.
 
1 8:28. What if there be five less than fifty just persons? wilt thou for 
five and forty destroy the whole city: and he said: i will not destroy 
it [???] if i find five and forty.
 
1 8:29. And again he said to him: but if forty be found there [???] what wilt 
thou do? he said: i will not destroy it for the sake of forty.
 
1 8:30. Lord [???] saith he [???] be not angry [???] i beseech thee [???] if i speak: what if 
thirty shall be found there? he answered: i will not do it [???] if i find 
thirty there.
 
1 8:31. Seeing [???] saith he [???] i have once begun [???] i will speak to my lord:
what if twenty be found there? he said: i will not destroy it for the 
sake of twenty.
 
1 8:32. I beseech thee [???] saith he [???] be not angry [???] lord [???] if i speak yet once 
more: what if ten shall be found there? and he said: i will not destroy 
it for the sake of ten.
 
1 8:33. And the lord departed [???] after he had left speaking to [???]: and 
[???]ham returned to his place.
 
[???]is chapter 19
 
Lot [???] [???]ining angels in his house [???] is delivered from [???] [???] which is 
destroyed: his wife for looking back is turned into a statue of salt.
 
1 9:1. And the two angels came to sodom in the evening [???] and lot was 
sitting in the gate of the city. And seeing them [???] he rose up and went to 
meet them: and worshipped prostrate to the ground.
 
1 9:2. And said: i beseech you [???] my lords [???] turn in to the house of your 
servant [???] and lodge there: wash your feet [???] and in the morning you shall 
go on your way. And they said: no [???] but we will abide in the street.
 
1 9:3. He pressed them very much to turn in unto him: and when they were 
come into his house [???] he made them a feast [???] and baked [???]ened bread [???] 
and they ate:
 
1 9:4. But before they went to bed [???] the men of the city beset the house [???] 
both young and old [???] all the people together.
 
1 9:5. And they called lot [???] and said to him: where are the men that came 
in to thee at night? bring them out hither [???] that we may know them:
 
1 9:6. Lot went out to them [???] and shut the door after him [???] and said:
 
1 9:7. Do not so [???] i beseech you [???] my brethren [???] do not commit this evil.
 
1 9:8. I have two daughters who [???] as yet [???] have not known man; i will bring 
them out to you [???] and abuse you them as it shall please you [???] so that you 
do no evil to these men [???] because they are come in under the shadow of my 
roof.
 
1 9:9. But they said: get thee back thither. And again: thou camest in [???] 
said they [???] as a stranger [???] was it to be a judge? therefore we will 
afflict thee more than them. And they pressed very violently upon lot:
and they were even at the point of breaking open the doors.
 
1 9:10. And behold the men put out their hand [???] and drew in lot unto them [???] 
and shut the door.
 
1 9:11. And them [???] that were without [???] they struck with blindness from the 
least to the greatest [???] so that they could not find the door.
 
1 9:12. And they said to lot: hast thou here any of thine? son-in-law [???] or 
sons [???] or daughters [???] all that are thine bring them out of this city:
 
1 9:13. For we will destroy this place [???] because their cry is grown loud 
before the lord [???] who hath sent us to destroy them.
 
1 9:14. So lot went out [???] and spoke to his sons-in-law that were to have 
his daughters [???] and said: arise: get you out of this place [???] because the 
lord will destroy this city. And he seemed to them to speak as it were 
in jest.
 
1 9:15. And when it was morning [???] the angels pressed him [???] saying: arise [???] 
take thy wife [???] and the two daughters that thou hast: lest thou also 
perish in the wickedness of the city.
 
1 9:16. And as he [???] [???] they took his hand [???] and the hand of his wife [???] 
and of his two daughters [???] because the lord spared him.
 
1 9:17. And they brought him forth [???] and set him without the city: and 
there they spoke to him [???] saying: save thy life: look not back [???] neither 
stay thou in all the country about: but save thy self in the mountain [???] 
lest thou be also [???].
 
1 9:18. And lot said to them: i beseech thee [???] my lord [???] 
 
1 9:19. Because thy servant hath found grace before thee [???] and thou hast 
magnified thy mercy [???] which thou hast shewn to me [???] in saving my life [???] and 
i cannot escape to the mountain [???] lest some evil seize me [???] and i die.
 
1 9:20. There is this city here at hand [???] to which i may [???] [???] it is a 
little one [???] and i shall be saved in it: is it not a little one [???] and my 
soul shall live?
 
1 9:21. And he said to him: behold also in this [???] i have heard thy 
prayers [???] not to destroy the city for which thou hast spoken.
 
1 9:22. Make haste [???] and be saved there: because i cannot do any thing 
till thou go in thither. Therefore the name of that city was called 
[???].
 
[???]... That is [???] a little one.
 
1 9:23. The sun was risen upon the earth [???] and lot entered into [???].
 
1 9:24. And the lord rained upon sodom and [???]a brimstone and fire 
from the lord out of heaven.
 
1 9:25. And he destroyed these cities [???] and all the country about [???] all the 
inhabitants of the cities [???] and all things that spring from the earth.
 
1 9:26. And his wife looking behind her [???] was turned into a statue of 
salt.
 
And his wife... As a standing memorial to the servants of god to proceed 
in virtue [???] and not to look back to vice or its [???].
 
1 9:27. And [???]ham got up early in the morning [???] and in the place where 
he had stood before with the lord:
 
1 9:28. He looked towards sodom and [???] [???] and the whole land of that 
country: and he saw the ashes rise up from the earth as the smoke of a 
[???].
 
1 9:29. Now when god destroyed the cities of that country [???] remembering
[???] [???] he delivered lot out of the destruction of the cities wherein 
he had [???].
 
1 9:30. And lot went up out of [???] [???] and [???]de in the mountain [???] and his 
two daughters with him (for he was afraid to stay in [???]) and he dwelt
in a cave [???] he and his two daughters with him.
 
1 9:31. And the elder said to the younger: our father is old [???] and there 
is no man left on the earth [???] to come in unto us after the manner of the 
whole earth.
 
1 9:32. Come [???] let us make him drunk with wine [???] and let us lie with him [???] 
that we may preserve seed of our father.
 
1 9:33. And they made their father drink wine that night: and the elder 
went in [???] and lay with her father: but he perceived not [???] neither when his 
daughter lay down [???] nor when she rose up.
 
1 9:34. And the next day the elder said to the younger: behold i lay last 
night with my father [???] let us make him drink wine also to night [???] and thou 
shalt lie with him [???] that we may save seed of our father.
 
1 9:35. They made their father drink wine that night also [???] and the 
younger daughter went in [???] and lay with him: and neither then did he 
perceive when she lay down [???] nor when she rose up.
 
1 9:36. So the two daughters of lot were with child by their father.
 
1 9:37. And the elder bore a son [???] and she called his name [???]: he is the 
father of the [???]ites unto this day.
 
1 9:38. The younger also bore a son [???] and she called his name [???]; that 
is [???] the son of my people: he is the father of the [???]ites unto this 
day.
 
[???]is chapter 20
 
[???]ham [???]ned in [???]: sara is taken into king [???]s's house [???] 
but by god's commandment is restored [???].
 
2 0:1. [???]ham removed from thence to the south country [???] and dwelt
between cades and sur [???] and [???]ned in [???].
 
2 0:2. And he said of sara his wife: she is my sister. So [???]ch the 
king of gera sent [???] and took her.
 
2 0:3. And god came to [???]ch in a dream by night [???] and he said to him:
lo thou shalt die for the woman that thou hast taken: for she hath a 
husband.
 
2 0:4. Now [???]ch had not touched her [???] and he said: lord [???] wilt thou 
slay a nation that is ignorant and just?
 
2 0:5. Did not he say to me: she is my sister: and she say [???] he is my 
brother? in the simplicity of my heart [???] and cleanness of my hands have i 
done this.
 
2 0:6. And god said to him: and i know that thou didst it with a [???]ere
heart: and therefore i [???]eld thee from sinning against me [???] and i 
suffered thee not to touch her.
 
2 0:7. Now therefore restore the man his wife [???] for he is a prophet: and 
he shall pray for thee [???] and thou shalt live: but if thou wilt not 
restore her [???] know that thou shalt surely die [???] thou and all that are 
thine.
 
2 0:8. And [???]ch forthwith rising up in the night [???] called all his 
servants: and spoke all these words in their hearing [???] and all the men 
were exceedingly afraid.
 
2 0:9. And [???]ch called also for [???] [???] and said to him: what hast 
thou done to us? what have we offended thee in [???] that thou hast brought 
upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done to us what thou 
oughtest not to do.
 
2 0:10. And again he [???]ulated with him [???] and said: what sawest thou [???] 
that thou hast done this?
 
2 0:11. [???]ham answered: i thought with myself [???] saying: perhaps there is 
not the fear of god in this place: and they will kill me for the sake of 
my wife:
 
2 0:12. [???] [???] otherwise also she is truly my sister [???] the daughter of 
my father [???] and not the daughter of my mother [???] and i took her to wife.
 
2 0:13. And after god brought me out of my father's house [???] i said to her:
thou shalt do me this kindness: in every place [???] to which we shall come [???] 
thou shalt say that i am thy brother.
 
2 0:14. And [???]ch took sheep and [???] [???] and servants and [???] [???] 
and gave to [???]: and restored to him sara his wife [???] 
 
2 0:15. And said: the land is before you [???] dwell wheresoever it shall 
please thee.
 
2 0:16. And to sara he said: behold i have given thy brother a thousand 
pieces of silver [???] this shall serve thee for a covering of thy eyes to 
all that are with thee [???] and whithersoever thou shalt go: and remember 
thou wast taken.
 
2 0:17. And when [???]ham [???] [???] god healed [???]ch and his wife [???] and 
his [???] [???] and they bore children:
 
2 0:18. For the lord had closed up every womb of the house of [???] [???] 
on account of [???] [???] [???]s's wife.
 
[???]is chapter 21
 
[???]ac is born. Agar and [???]ael are cast forth.
 
2 1:1. And the lord visited [???] [???] as he had promised: and fulfilled what 
he had spoken.
 
2 1:2. And she conceived and bore a son in her old age [???] at the time that 
god had foretold her.
 
2 1:3. And [???]ham called the name of his son [???] whom sara bore him [???] [???].
 
[???]... This word signifies laughter.
 
2 1:4. And he [???]ised him the eighth day [???] as god had commanded him [???] 
 
2 1:5. When he was a hundred years old: for at this age of his father [???] 
was [???]ac born.
 
2 1:6. And sara said: god hath made a laughter for me: whosoever shall 
hear of it will laugh with me.
 
2 1:7. And again she said: who would believe that [???]ham should hear 
that sara gave suck to a son [???] whom she bore to him in his old age?
 
2 1:8. And the child grew [???] and was [???]: and [???]ham made a great feast 
on the day of his [???].
 
2 1:9. And when sara had seen the son of [???] [???] the egyptian [???] playing with 
[???] [???] her son [???] she said to [???]:
 
2 1:10. Cast out this [???]oman and her son; for the son of the [???]oman
shall not be heir with my son [???].
 
2 1:11. [???]ham took this grievously for his son.
 
2 1:12. And god said to him: let it not seem grievous to thee for the 
boy [???] and for thy [???]: in all that sara hath said to thee [???] hearken
to her voice: for in [???]ac shall thy seed be called.
 
2 1:13. But i will make the son also of the [???]oman a great nation [???] 
because he is thy seed.
 
2 1:14. So [???]ham rose up in the morning [???] and taking bread and a bottle 
of water [???] put it upon her shoulder [???] and delivered the boy [???] and sent her 
away. And she departed [???] and wandered in the wilderness of [???].
 
2 1:15. And when the water in the bottle was spent [???] she cast the boy 
under one of the trees that were there.
 
2 1:16. And she went her way [???] and sat over against him a great way off [???] as 
far as a bow can carry [???] for she said: i will not see the boy die: and 
sitting over against [???] she lifted up her voice and wept.
 
2 1:17. And god heard the voice of the boy: and an angel of god called to 
agar from heaven [???] saying: what art thou doing [???] [???]? fear not; for god 
hath heard the voice of the boy [???] from the place wherein he is.
 
2 1:18. Arise [???] take up the boy [???] and hold him by the hand [???] for i will make 
him a great nation.
 
2 1:19. And god opened her eyes: and she saw a well of water [???] and went 
and filled the bottle [???] and gave the boy to drink.
 
2 1:20. And god was with him: and he grew [???] and dwelt in the wilderness [???] 
and became a young man [???] an [???].
 
2 1:21. And he dwelt in the wilderness of [???] [???] and his mother took a 
wife for him out of the land of egypt.
 
2 1:22. At the same time [???] [???] and [???]col the general of his army [???] 
said to [???]: god is with thee in all that thou dost.
 
2 1:23. Swear therefore by god [???] that thou wilt not hurt me [???] nor my 
posterity [???] nor my stock: but according to the kindness that i have done 
to thee [???] thou shalt do to me [???] and to the land wherein thou hast lived a 
stranger.
 
2 1:24. And [???]ham said: i will swear.
 
2 1:25. And he reproved [???]ch for a well of water [???] which his servants 
had taken away by force.
 
2 1:26. And [???]ch answered: i knew not who did this thing: and thou 
didst not tell me [???] and i heard not of it till today.
 
2 1:27. Then [???]ham took sheep and [???] [???] and gave them to [???]: and 
both of them made a league.
 
2 1:28. And [???]ham set apart seven [???]bs of the flock.
 
2 1:29. And [???]ch said to him: what mean these seven [???]bs which 
thou hast set apart?
 
2 1:30. But he said: thou shalt take seven [???]bs at my hand: that they 
may be a testimony for me [???] that i dug this well.
 
2 1:31. Therefore that place was called [???]; because there both of 
them did swear.
 
[???]... That is [???] the well of oath.
 
2 1:32. And they made a league for the well of oath.
 
2 1:33. And [???]ch and [???] [???] the general of his army [???] arose and 
returned to the land of the [???]. But [???]ham planted a grove in 
[???] [???] and there called upon the name of the lord god eternal.
 
2 1:34. And he was a [???]ner in the land of the [???]ines many days.
 
[???]is chapter 22
 
The faith and obedience of [???]ham is proved in his readiness to 
sacrifice his son [???]. He is stayed from the act by an angel. Former 
promises are renewed to him. His brother [???]s's issue.
 
2 2:1. After these things [???] god tempted [???] [???] and said to him: [???] [???] 
[???]. And he answered: here i am.
 
God tempted [???] etc... God tempteth no man to evil [???] james 1. 13; but by 
trial and [???]riment maketh known to the world [???] and to ourselves [???] what 
we are [???] as here by this trial the singular faith and obedience of 
[???]ham was made manifest.
 
2 2:2. He said to him: take thy only begotten son [???] [???] whom thou 
[???] [???] and go into the land of vision; and there thou shalt offer him 
for an [???]aust upon one of the mountains which i will shew thee.
 
2 2:3. So [???]ham rising up in the night [???] [???]led his ass [???] and took with 
him two young men [???] and [???]ac his son: and when he had cut wood for the 
[???] [???] he went his way to the place which god had commanded him.
 
2 2:4. And on the third day [???] [???]ting up his eyes [???] he saw the place afar 
off.
 
2 2:5. And he said to his young men: stay you here with the ass; i and 
the boy will go with speed as far as yonder [???] and after we have 
[???] [???] will return to you.
 
2 2:6. And he took the wood for the [???] [???] and laid it upon [???]ac his 
son; and he himself carried in his hands fire and a sword. And as they 
two went on together [???] 
 
2 2:7. [???]ac said to his father: my father. And he answered: what wilt 
thou [???] son? behold [???] saith he [???] fire and wood: where is the victim for the 
[???]?
 
2 2:8. And [???]ham said: god will provide himself a victim for an 
[???] [???] my son. So they went on together.
 
2 2:9. And they came to the place which god had shewn him [???] where he built 
an altar [???] and laid the wood in order upon it; and when he had bound 
[???]ac his son [???] he laid him on the altar upon the pile of wood.
 
2 2:10. And he put forth his hand [???] and took the sword [???] to sacrifice his 
son.
 
2 2:11. And behold [???] an angel of the lord from heaven called to him [???] 
saying: [???] [???] [???]. And he answered: here i am.
 
2 2:12. And he said to him: lay not thy hand upon the boy [???] neither do 
thou any thing to him: now i know that thou [???]rest god [???] and hast not 
spared thy only begotten son for my sake.
 
2 2:13. [???]ham lifted up his eyes [???] and saw behind his back a ram [???] 
amongst the [???] [???] [???]king fast by the horns [???] which he took and 
offered for a [???]aust instead of his son.
 
2 2:14. And he called the name of that place [???] the lord [???]. Whereupon [???] 
even to this day [???] it is said: in the mountain the lord will see.
 
2 2:15. And the angel of the lord called to [???]ham a second time from 
heaven [???] saying:
 
2 2:16. By my own self have i sworn [???] saith the lord: because thou hast 
done this thing [???] and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake:
 
2 2:17. I will bless thee [???] and i will [???]ly thy seed as the stars of 
heaven [???] and as the sand that is by the sea shore; thy seed shall possess 
the gates of their enemies.
 
2 2:18. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed [???] 
because thou hast obeyed my voice.
 
2 2:19. [???]ham returned to his young men [???] and they went to [???]ee
together [???] and he dwelt there.
 
2 2:20. After these things [???] it was told [???] [???] that [???]a also had 
borne children to [???]or his brother.
 
2 2:21. Hus [???] the [???] [???] and [???] [???] his brother [???] and camuel the father 
of the [???] [???] 
 
2 2:22. And [???] [???] and [???] [???] and [???] [???] and [???] [???] 
 
2 2:23. And [???] [???] of whom was born [???]: these eight did [???]a
bear to [???] [???] [???]s's brother.
 
2 2:24. And his [???] [???] named [???] [???] bore [???] [???] and [???] [???] and [???] [???] 
and [???].
 
[???]is chapter 23
 
[???]s's death and burial in the field bought of [???].
 
2 3:1. And sara lived a hundred and twenty-seven years.
 
2 3:2. And she died in the city of [???]ee which is [???] [???] in the land of 
[???]: and [???]ham came to mourn and weep for her.
 
2 3:3. And after he rose up from the funeral [???] [???] he spoke to the 
children of [???] [???] saying:
 
2 3:4. I am a stranger and [???]ner among you: give me the right of a 
burying place with you [???] that i may bury my dead.
 
2 3:5. The children of heth answered [???] saying:
 
2 3:6. My lord [???] hear us [???] thou art a prince of god among us: bury thy dead 
in our principal [???]: and no man shall have power to hinder thee 
from burying thy dead in his [???].
 
2 3:7. [???]ham rose up [???] and bowed down to the people of the land [???] to wit [???] 
the children of [???]:
 
Bowed down to the people... [???] [???] literally [???]. But this word 
here [???] as well as in many other places in the latin [???] [???] is used 
to signify only an inferior honour and reverence paid to men [???] expressed 
by a bowing down of the body.
 
2 3:8. And said to them: if it please your soul that i should bury my 
dead [???] hear me [???] and [???]de for me to [???]ron the son of [???].
 
2 3:9. That he may give me the double cave [???] which he hath in the end of 
his field: for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me before 
you [???] for a possession of a burying place.
 
2 3:10. Now [???]ron dwelt in the midst of the children of [???]. And [???]ron
made answer to [???]ham in the hearing of all that went in at the gate of 
the city [???] saying:
 
2 3:11. Let it not be so [???] my lord [???] but do thou rather hearken to what i 
say: the field i deliver to thee [???] and the cave that is therein; in the 
presence of the children of my people [???] bury thy dead.
 
2 3:12. [???]ham bowed down before the people of the land.
 
2 3:13. And he spoke to [???] [???] in the presence of the people: i beseech 
thee to hear me: i will give money for the field; take it [???] and so will i 
bury my dead in it.
 
2 3:14. And [???]ron answered:
 
2 3:15. My lord [???] hear me. The ground which thou [???] [???] is worth four 
hundred sicles of silver: this is the price between me and thee: but 
what is this? bury thy dead.
 
2 3:16. And when [???]ham had heard this [???] he weighed out the money that 
[???]ron had asked [???] in the hearing of the children of [???] [???] four hundred 
sicles of silver [???] of common current money.
 
2 3:17. And the field that before was [???]'s [???] wherein was the double 
cave [???] looking towards [???] [???] both it and the cave [???] and all the trees 
thereof [???] in all its limits round about [???] 
 
2 3:18. Was made sure to [???]ham for a possession [???] in the sight of the 
children of [???] [???] and of all that went in at the gate of his city.
 
2 3:19. And so [???]ham buried [???] [???] his wife [???] in the double cave of the 
field [???] that looked towards [???] [???] this is [???]ron in the land of 
[???].
 
2 3:20. And the field was made sure to [???] [???] and the cave that was in 
it [???] for a possession to bury in [???] by the children of [???].
 
[???]is chapter 24
 
[???]s's servant [???] sent by him into [???] [???] bringeth from thence 
[???] [???] who is married to [???].
 
2 4:1. Now [???]ham was old [???] and advanced in age; and the lord had blessed 
him in all things.
 
2 4:2. And he said to the elder servant of his house [???] who was ruler over 
all he had: put thy hand under my thigh [???] 
 
2 4:3. That i may make thee swear by the lord [???] the god of heaven and 
earth [???] that thou take not a wife for my son [???] of the daughters of the 
[???] [???] among whom i dwell:
 
2 4:4. But that thou go to my own country and kindred [???] and take a wife 
from thence for my son [???].
 
2 4:5. The servant answered: if the woman will not come with me into this 
land [???] must i bring thy son back again to the place from whence thou 
camest out?
 
2 4:6. And [???]ham said: beware thou never bring my son back again 
thither.
 
2 4:7. The lord god of heaven [???] who took me out of my father's house [???] and 
out of my native country [???] who spoke to me [???] and swore to me [???] saying: to 
thy seed will i give this land: he will send his angel before thee [???] and 
thou shalt take from thence a wife for my son.
 
He will send his angel before thee... This shows that the [???]ws
believed that god gave them guardian angels for their protection.
 
2 4:8. But if the woman will not follow thee [???] thou shalt not be bound by 
the oath: only bring not my son back thither again.
 
2 4:9. The servant [???] therefore [???] put his hand under the thigh of [???] [???] 
his lord [???] and swore to him upon his word.
 
2 4:10. And he took ten camels of his master's herd [???] and departed [???] 
carrying something of all his goods with him [???] and he set forward and 
went on to [???] [???] to the city of [???].
 
2 4:11. And when he had made the camels lie down without the town [???] near a 
well of water [???] in the evening [???] at the time when women are wont to come 
out to draw water [???] he said:
 
2 4:12. O lord [???] the god of my master [???] [???] [???] meet me today [???] i beseech 
thee [???] and shew kindness to my master [???] [???].
 
2 4:13. Behold [???] i stand nigh the spring of water [???] and the daughters of 
the inhabitants of this city will come out to draw water:
 
2 4:14. Now [???] therefore [???] the maid to whom i shall say: let down thy 
pitcher that i may drink: and she shall answer [???] drink [???] and i will give 
thy camels drink also: let it be the same whom thou hast provided for 
thy servant [???]: and by this [???] i shall understand that thou hast shewn
kindness to my master.
 
2 4:15. He had not yet ended these words within himself [???] and behold 
[???]ca came out [???] the daughter of [???] [???] son of [???] [???] wife to [???]or
the brother of [???] [???] having a pitcher on her shoulder:
 
2 4:16. An exceeding comely maid [???] and a most beautiful virgin [???] and not 
known to man: and she went down to the spring [???] and filled her [???] [???] 
and was coming back.
 
2 4:17. And the servant ran to meet her [???] and said: give me a little water 
to drink of thy [???].
 
2 4:18. And she answered: drink [???] my lord. And quickly she let down the 
pitcher upon her arm [???] and gave him drink.
 
2 4:19. And when he had drunk [???] she said: i will draw water for thy camels
also [???] till they all drink.
 
2 4:20. And pouring out the pitcher into the [???] [???] she ran back to the 
well to draw water; and having drawn [???] she gave to all the [???].
 
2 4:21. But he [???] [???] beheld her with silence [???] [???]rous to know whether 
the lord had made his journey prosperous or not.
 
2 4:22. And after that the camels had drunk [???] the man took out golden 
[???] [???] weighing two [???]; and as many [???] [???] of ten sicles
weight.
 
2 4:23. And he said to her: whose daughter art thou? tell me: is there 
any place in thy father's house to lodge?
 
2 4:24. And she answered: i am the daughter of [???] [???] the son of 
[???] [???] whom she bore to [???].
 
2 4:25. And she said [???] moreover [???] to him: we have good store of both straw 
and hay [???] and a large place to lodge in.
 
2 4:26. The man bowed himself down [???] and adored the lord [???] 
 
2 4:27. Saying: blessed be the lord god of my master [???] [???] who hath 
not taken away his mercy and truth from my master [???] and hath brought me 
the straight way into the house of my master's brother.
 
2 4:28. Then the maid ran [???] and told in her mother's house all that she 
had heard.
 
2 4:29. And [???]ca had a brother [???] named [???] [???] who went out in haste to 
the man [???] to the well.
 
2 4:30. And when he had seen the [???]ings and bracelets in his sister's 
hands [???] and had heard all that she [???] [???] saying [???] thus and thus the man 
spoke to me: he came to the man who stood by the [???] [???] and near to the 
spring of water [???] 
 
2 4:31. And said to him: come in [???] thou blessed of the lord; why standest
thou without? i have prepared the house [???] and a place for the [???].
 
2 4:32. And he brought him into his lodging; and he [???]ed the 
[???] [???] and gave straw and hay [???] and water to wash his feet [???] and the feet 
of the men that were come with him.
 
2 4:33. And bread was set before him. But he said: i will not eat [???] till i 
tell my message. He answered him: speak.
 
2 4:34. And he said: i am the servant of [???]:
 
2 4:35. And the lord hath blessed my master [???] [???] and he is become 
great: and he hath given him sheep and [???] [???] silver and gold [???] men 
servants and women servants [???] camels and [???].
 
2 4:36. And [???] [???] my master's wife [???] hath borne my master a son in her old 
age [???] and he hath given him all that he had.
 
2 4:37. And my master made me swear [???] saying: thou shalt not take a wife 
for my son of the [???] [???] in whose land i dwell:
 
2 4:38. But thou shalt go to my father's house [???] and shalt take a wife of 
my own kindred for my son:
 
2 4:39. But i answered my master: what if the woman will not come with 
me?
 
2 4:40. The lord [???] said he [???] in whose sight i walk [???] will send his angel 
with thee [???] and will direct thy way: and thou shalt take a wife for my 
son of my own kindred [???] and of my father's house.
 
2 4:41. But thou shalt be clear from my curse [???] when thou shalt come to my 
kindred [???] if they will not give thee one.
 
2 4:42. And i came today to the well of water [???] and said: o lord god of my 
master [???] [???] [???] if thou hast [???]ered my way [???] wherein i now walk [???] 
 
2 4:43. Behold [???] i stand by the well of water [???] and the virgin [???] that shall 
come out to draw water [???] who shall hear me say: give me a little water to 
drink of thy [???]:
 
2 4:44. And shall say to me: both drink thou [???] and i will also draw for 
thy [???]: let the same be the woman [???] whom the lord hath prepared for 
my master's son.
 
2 4:45. And whilst i pondered these things secretly with myself [???] [???]ca
appeared [???] coming with a [???] [???] which she carried on her shoulder: and 
she went down to the well and drew water. And i said to her: give me a 
little to drink.
 
2 4:46. And she speedily let down the pitcher from her shoulder [???] and said 
to me: both drink thou [???] and to thy camels i will give drink. I drank [???] 
and she watered the [???].
 
2 4:47. And i asked her [???] and said: whose daughter art thou? and she 
answered: i am the daughter of [???] [???] the son of [???] [???] whom [???]a
bore to him. So i put [???]ings on her to adorn her face [???] and i put 
bracelets on her hands.
 
2 4:48. And falling down [???] i adored the lord [???] blessing the lord god of my 
master [???] [???] [???] who hath brought me the straight way to take the 
daughter of my master's brother for his son.
 
2 4:49. Wherefore [???] if you do according to mercy and truth with my master [???] 
tell me: but if it please you otherwise [???] tell me that also [???] that i may 
go to the right hand [???] or to the left.
 
2 4:50. And [???]an and bathuel answered: the word hath proceeded from the 
lord: we cannot speak any other thing to thee but his pleasure.
 
2 4:51. Behold [???] [???]ca is before thee [???] take her and go thy way [???] and let 
her be the wife of thy master's son [???] as the lord hath spoken.
 
2 4:52. Which when [???]s's servant heard [???] falling down to the ground [???] 
he adored the lord.
 
2 4:53. And bringing forth [???]els of silver and gold [???] and garments [???] he 
gave them to [???] [???] for a present. He offered gifts also to her 
brothers [???] and to her mother.
 
2 4:54. And a banquet was made [???] and they ate and drank together [???] and 
lodged there. And in the morning [???] the servant arose [???] and said: let me 
depart [???] that i may go to my master.
 
2 4:55. And her brother and mother answered: let the maid stay [???] at least [???] 
ten days with us [???] and afterwards she shall depart.
 
2 4:56. Stay me not [???] said he [???] because the lord hath [???]ered my way:
send me away [???] that i may go to my master.
 
2 4:57. And they said: let us call the maid [???] and ask her will.
 
Let us call the maid [???] and ask her will... Not as to her marriage [???] as she 
had already [???] [???] but of her quitting her parents and going to her 
husband.
 
2 4:58. And they called her [???] and when she was come [???] they asked: wilt thou 
go with this man? she said: i will go.
 
2 4:59. So they sent her away [???] and her nurse [???] and [???]s's servant [???] and 
his company.
 
2 4:60. Wishing prosperity to their sister [???] and saying: thou art our 
sister [???] mayst thou increase to thousands of thousands; and may thy seed 
possess the gates of their enemies.
 
2 4:61. So [???]ca and her maids [???] being set upon [???] [???] followed the 
man: who with speed returned to his master.
 
2 4:62. At the same time [???] [???]ac was walking along the way to the well 
which is called of the living and the seeing: for he dwelt in the south 
country:
 
2 4:63. And he was gone forth to meditate in the field [???] the day being now 
well spent: and when he had lifted up his eyes [???] he saw camels coming 
afar off.
 
2 4:64. [???]ca also [???] when she saw [???] [???] lighted off the [???] [???] 
 
2 4:65. And said to the servant: who is that man who cometh towards us 
along the field? and he said to her: that man is my master. But she 
quickly took her cloak [???] and covered herself.
 
2 4:66. And the servant told [???]ac all that he had done.
 
2 4:67. Who brought her into the tent of sara his mother [???] and took her to 
wife: and he loved her so much [???] that it moderated the sorrow which was 
[???]oned by his mother's death.

2 5:6. And to the children of the [???]ines he gave gifts [???] and separated
them from [???]ac his son [???] while he yet lived [???] to the east country.
 
[???]... Agar and [???]ra are here called [???] [???] (though they 
were lawful wives [???] and in other places are so called [???]) because they were 
of an inferior degree [???] and such in [???]ure are usually called 
[???].
 
2 5:7. And the days of [???]s's life were a hundred and [???]ive-five 
years.
 
2 5:8. And [???]ying he died in a good old age [???] and having lived a long 
time [???] and being full of days: and was [???]ered to his people.

was [???]ated in the field of [???]ron the son of seor the [???] [???] over 
against [???] [???] 
 
2 5:10. Which he had bought of the children of [???]: there was he buried [???] 
and sara his wife.
 
2 5:11. And after his death [???] god blessed [???]ac his son [???] who dwelt by the 
well named of the living and seeing.
 
2 5:12. These are the generations of [???]ael the son of [???] [???] whom agar
the egyptian [???] [???]s's servant [???] bore unto him:
 
2 5:13. And these are the names of his children according to their 
calling and [???]. The firstborn of [???]ael was [???] [???] then

daughter of bathuel the syrian of [???] [???] sister to [???].
 
2 5:21. And [???]ac besought the lord for his wife [???] because she was barren:
and he heard him [???] and made [???]ca to conceive.
 
2 5:22. But the children struggled in her womb [???] and she said: if it were 
to be so with me [???] what need was there to conceive? and she went to 
consult the lord.
 
2 5:23. And he answering [???] said: two nations are in thy womb [???] and two 
[???]ples shall be divided out of thy womb [???] and one people shall overcome 
the other [???] and the elder shall serve the younger.
 
2 5:24. And when her time was come to be delivered [???] behold twins were 
found in her womb.
 
2 5:25. He that came forth first was red [???] and hairy like a skin: and his 
name was called [???]. Immediately the other coming forth [???] held his 
brother's foot in his hand: and therefore he was called [???].

him.
 
2 5:27. And when they were grown up [???] esau became a skilful hunter [???] and a 
[???]: but [???] [???] a plain man [???] dwelt in tents.
 
2 5:28. [???]ac loved [???] [???] because he ate of his hunting: and [???]ca
loved [???].
 
2 5:29. And [???]b boiled [???]: to whom [???] [???] coming faint out of the 
field [???] 
 
2 5:30. Said: give me of this red [???] [???] for i am exceeding faint. For 
which reason his name was called [???].
 
2 5:31. And [???]b said to him: sell me thy first [???].
 
2 5:32. He answered: lo i die [???] what will the first birthright avail me?
 
2 5:33. [???]b said: swear therefore to me. Esau swore to him [???] and sold 
his first [???].
 
2 5:34. And so taking bread and the [???]age of [???] [???] he ate [???] and 
drank [???] and went on his way; making little account of having sold his 
first [???].

[???]ac [???]eth in [???] [???] where god reneweth to him the promise made 
to [???]. King [???]ch maketh league with him.
 
2 6:1. And when a famine came in the land [???] after that barrenness which 
had happened in the days of [???] [???] [???]ac went to [???] [???] king of 
the [???] [???] to [???].
 
2 6:2. And the lord appeared to him [???] and said: go not down into egypt [???] 
but stay in the land that i shall tell thee.
 
2 6:3. And [???]urn in it [???] and i will be with thee [???] and will bless thee:
for to thee and to thy seed i will give all these countries [???] to fulfil
the oath which i swore to [???]ham thy father.
 
2 6:4. And i will [???]ly thy seed like the stars of heaven: and i will 
give to thy posterity all these countries: and in thy seed shall all the 
nations of the earth be blessed.
 
2 6:5. Because [???]ham obeyed my voice [???] and kept my [???]ts and 
[???] [???] and observed my ceremonies and laws.
 
2 6:6. So [???]ac [???]de in [???].
 
2 6:7. And when he was asked by the men of that place [???] concerning his 
wife [???] he answered: she is my sister: for he was afraid to confess that 
she was his wife [???] thinking lest perhaps they would kill him because of 
her beauty.
 
2 6:8. And when very many days were passed [???] and he [???]de there [???] 
[???] [???] king of the [???] [???] looking out through a window [???] saw him 
playing with [???] [???] his wife.
 
2 6:9. And calling for him [???] he said: it is evident she is thy wife: why 
didst thou feign her to be thy sister? he answered: i feared lest i 
should die for her sake.
 
2 6:10. And [???]ch said: why hast thou deceived us? some man of the 
people might havelain with thy wife [???] and thou hadst brought upon us a 
great sin. And he commanded all the people [???] saying:
 
2 6:11. He that shall touch this man's wife [???] shall surely be put to 
death.
 
2 6:12. And [???]ac sowed in that land [???] and he found that same year a 
[???]: and the lord blessed him.
 
2 6:13. And the man was [???] [???] and he went on [???]ering and 
increasing [???] till he became exceeding great.
 
2 6:14. And he had possessions of sheep and of [???] [???] and a very great 
family. Wherefore the [???]ines [???]ying him [???] 
 
2 6:15. Stopped up at that time all the [???] [???] that the servants of his 
father [???] [???] [???] had [???] [???] filling them up with earth:
 
2 6:16. [???]uch that [???]ch himself said to [???]: depart from us [???] 
for thou art become much mightier than we.
 
2 6:17. So he departed [???] and came to the torrent of [???] [???] to dwell 
there:
 
2 6:18. And he digged again other [???] [???] which the servants of his 
father [???] [???] [???] had [???] [???] and which [???] after his death [???] the [???]ines
had of old stopped up: and he called them by the same names [???] by which 
his father before had called them.
 
2 6:19. And they digged in the [???] [???] and found living water:
 
[???]... That is [???] a channel where sometimes a torrent or violent 
stream had run.
 
2 6:20. But there also the [???]men of gera strove against the [???]men
of [???] [???] saying: it is our water. Wherefore he called the name of the 
well [???] on occasion of that which had happened [???] [???].
 
2 6:21. And they digged also another; and for that they [???]lled
likewise [???] and he called the name of it [???] enmity.
 
2 6:22. Going forward from thence [???] he digged another well [???] for which they 
contended not; therefore he called the name thereof [???] [???] [???] saying:
now hath the lord given us room [???] and made us to increase upon the earth.
 
[???]... That is [???] [???] [???] or room.
 
2 6:23. And he went up from that place to [???] [???] 
 
2 6:24. Where the lord appeared to him that same night [???] saying: i am the 
god of [???]ham thy father [???] do not fear [???] for i am with thee: i will bless 
thee [???] and [???]ly thy seed for my servant [???]s's sake.
 
2 6:25. And he built there an altar: and called upon the name of the 
lord [???] and pitched his tent; and commanded his servants to dig a well.
 
2 6:26. To which place when [???] [???] and [???]ath his friend [???] and 
[???]col chief captain of his soldiers [???] came from [???] [???] 
 
2 6:27. [???]ac said to them: why are ye come to me [???] a man whom you hate [???] 
and have thrust out from you?
 
2 6:28. And they answered: we saw that the lord is with thee [???] and 
therefore we said: let there be an oath between us [???] and let us make a 
[???] [???] 
 
2 6:29. That thou do us no harm [???] as we on our part have touched nothing 
of thine [???] nor have done any thing to hurt thee; but with peace have sent 
thee away [???] increased with the blessing of the lord.
 
2 6:30. And he made them a feast [???] and after they had eaten and drunk:
 
2 6:31. Arising in the morning [???] they swore one to another: and [???]ac sent 
them away peaceably to their own home.
 
2 6:32. And behold [???] the same day the servants of [???]ac came [???] telling him 
of a well which they had [???] [???] and saying: we have found water.
 
2 6:33. Whereupon he called it abundance: and the name of the city was 
called [???] [???] even to this day.
 
2 6:34. And esau being forty years old [???] married wives [???] [???] [???] the 
daughter of [???] [???] the [???] [???] and [???] [???] the daughter of [???] [???] of 
the same place.
 
2 6:35. And they both offended the mind of [???]ac and [???].
 
[???]is chapter 27
 
[???] [???] by him mother's counsel [???] obtaineth his father's blessing instead 
of [???]. And by her is advised to fly to his uncle [???].
 
2 7:1. Now [???]ac was old [???] and his eyes were dim [???] and he could not see:
and he called [???] [???] his elder son [???] and said to him: my son? and he 
answered: here i am.
 
2 7:2. And his father said to him [???] thou seest that i am old [???] and know not 
the day of my death.
 
2 7:3. Take thy arms [???] thy [???] [???] and bow [???] and go abroad; and when thou 
hast taken something by hunting [???] 
 
2 7:4. Make me a [???]ury meat thereof [???] as thou knowest i like [???] and bring 
it that i may eat: and my soul may bless thee [???] before i die.
 
2 7:5. And when [???]ca had heard this [???] and he was gone into the field to 
fulfil his father's commandment [???] 
 
2 7:6. She said to her son [???]: i heard thy father talking with [???] [???] 
thy brother [???] and saying to him:
 
2 7:7. Bring me of thy hunting [???] and make me meats that i may eat [???] and 
bless thee in the sight of the lord [???] before i die.
 
2 7:8. Now therefore [???] my son [???] follow my counsel:
 
2 7:9. And go thy way to the flock [???] bring me two kids of the best [???] that i 
may make of them meat for thy father [???] such as he gladly [???].
 
2 7:10. Which when thou hast brought in [???] and he hath eaten [???] he may bless 
thee before he die.
 
2 7:11. And he answered her: thou knowest that [???] [???] my brother [???] is a 
hairy man [???] and i am smooth:
 
2 7:12. If my father should feel me [???] and perceive it [???] i fear lest he will 
think i would have mocked him [???] and i shall bring upon me a curse instead 
of a blessing.
 
2 7:13. And his mother said to him: upon me be this curse [???] my son: only 
hear thou my voice [???] and go [???] fetch me the things which i have said.
 
2 7:14. He went [???] and brought [???] and gave them to his mother. She dressed 
[???] [???] such as she knew his father liked.
 
2 7:15. And she put on him very good garments of [???] [???] which she had at 
home with her:
 
2 7:16. And the little skins of the kids she put about his hands [???] and 
covered the bare of his neck.
 
2 7:17. And she gave him the [???]ury meat [???] and delivered him bread that 
she had [???].
 
2 7:18. Which when he had carried in [???] he said: my father? but he 
answered: i hear. Who art thou [???] my son?
 
2 7:19. And [???]b said: i am [???] [???] thy [???]: i have done as thou 
didst command me: arise [???] sit and eat of my [???] [???] that thy soul may 
bless me.
 
I am esau thy [???]... St. [???]ine (L. Contra [???] [???] C. 10) [???] 
treating at large upon this place [???] excuseth [???]b from a lie [???] because 
this whole passage was mysterious [???] as relating to the [???]erence which 
was afterwards to be given to the gentiles before the [???]al [???] [???] which 
[???]b by prophetic light might understand. So far is certain [???] that the 
first [???] [???] both by divine election and by es's free [???]ion
[???]ged to [???]: so that if there were any lie in the case [???] it could 
be no more than an officious and venial one.
 
2 7:20. And [???]ac said to his son: how couldst thou find it so quickly [???] 
my son? he answered: it was the will of god [???] that what i sought came 
quickly in my way:
 
2 7:21. And [???]ac said: come hither [???] that i may feel thee [???] my son [???] and 
may prove whether thou be my son [???] [???] or no.
 
2 7:22. He came near to his father [???] and when he had felt him [???] [???]ac said:
the voice indeed is the voice of [???]; but the hands [???] are the hands of 
[???].
 
2 7:23. And he knew him not [???] because his hairy hands made him like to the 
elder. Then blessing him [???] 
 
2 7:24. He said: art thou my son [???]? he answered: i am.
 
2 7:25. Then he said: bring me the meats of thy hunting [???] my son [???] that my 
soul may bless thee. And when they were brought [???] and he had eaten [???] he 
offered him wine also [???] which after he had drunk [???] 
 
2 7:26. He said to him: come near me [???] and give me a kiss [???] my son.
 
2 7:27. He came near [???] and kissed him. And immediately as he [???]lled the 
fragrant smell of his garments [???] blessing him [???] he said: behold [???] the smell 
of my son is as the smell of a plentiful field [???] which the lord hath 
blessed.
 
2 7:28. God give thee of the dew of heaven [???] and of the fatness of the 
earth [???] abundance of corn and wine.
 
2 7:29. And let [???]ples serve thee [???] and tribes worship thee: be thou lord 
of thy brethren [???] and let thy mother's children bow down before thee.
cursed be he that curseth thee: and let him that blesseth thee be filled 
with blessings.
 
2 7:30. [???]ac had scarce ended his words [???] when [???] [???]b being now gone out 
abroad [???] esau came [???] 
 
2 7:31. And brought in to his father [???] [???] made of what he had taken in 
hunting [???] saying: arise [???] my father [???] and eat of thy son's [???]; that 
thy soul may bless me.
 
2 7:32. And [???]ac said to him: why! who art thou? he answered: i am thy 
firstborn son [???] [???].
 
2 7:33. [???]ac was struck with fear [???] and astonished exceedingly; and 
wondering beyond what can be believed [???] said: who is he then that even 
now brought me venison that he had taken [???] and i ate of all before thou 
[???]? and i have blessed him [???] and he shall be blessed.
 
2 7:34. Esau having heard his father's words [???] roared out with a great 
cry; and [???] being in a [???] [???] said: bless me also [???] my father.
 
2 7:35. And he said: thy brother came deceitfully and got thy blessing.
 
2 7:36. But he said again: rightly is his name called [???]; for he hath 
[???]ted me lo this second time: my birthright he took away before [???] 
and now this second time he hath stolen away my blessing. And again he 
said to his father: hast thou not reserved me also a blessing?
 
[???]... That is [???] a [???].
 
2 7:37. [???]ac answered: i have appointed him thy lord [???] and have made all 
his brethren his servants: i have established him with corn and wine [???] 
and after this [???] what shall i do more for thee [???] my son?
 
2 7:38. And esau said to him: hast thou only one blessing [???] father? i 
beseech thee bless me also. And when he wept with a loud cry [???] 
 
2 7:39. [???]ac being moved [???] said to him: in the fat of the earth [???] and in 
the dew of heaven from above [???] 
 
2 7:40. Shall thy blessing be. Thou shalt live by the sword [???] and shalt 
serve thy brother: and the time shall come [???] when thou shalt shake off 
and loose his yoke from thy neck.
 
2 7:41. Esau therefore always hated [???] [???] for the blessing wherewith his 
father had blessed him; and he said in his heart: the days will come of 
the mourning for my father [???] and i will kill my brother [???].
 
2 7:42. These things were told to [???]: and she sent and called [???] [???] 
her son [???] and said to him: behold [???] [???] thy brother [???] threateneth to kill 
thee.
 
2 7:43. Now therefore [???] my son [???] hear my voice [???] arise and flee to [???] [???] my 
brother [???] to [???]:
 
2 7:44. And thou shalt dwell with him a few days [???] till the wrath of thy 
brother be [???] [???] 
 
2 7:45. And his indignation cease [???] and he forget the things thou hast 
done to him: afterwards i will send [???] and bring thee from thence hither.
why shall i be [???]ived of both my sons in one day?
 
2 7:46. And [???]ca said to [???]: i am weary of my life [???] because of the 
daughters of [???]: if [???]b take a wife of the stock of this land [???] i 
choose not to live.

[???]s's journey to [???]: his vision and vow.
 
2 8:1. And [???]ac called [???] [???] and blessed him [???] and charged him [???] saying:
take not a wife of the stock of [???]:
 
2 8:2. But go [???] and take a journey to [???]ia of [???] [???] to the house 
of [???] [???] thy mother's father [???] and take thee a wife thence of the 
daughters of [???] [???] thy uncle.
 
2 8:3. And god [???]ty bless thee [???] and make thee to increase and 
[???]ly thee: that thou mayst be a multitude of people.
 
2 8:4. And give the blessings of [???]ham to thee [???] and to thy seed after 
thee: that thou mayst possess the land of thy [???] [???] which he 
promised to thy grandfather.
 
2 8:5. And when [???]ac had sent him away [???] he took his journey and went to 
[???]ia of [???] [???] to [???] [???] the son of [???] [???] the [???] [???] brother 
to [???] [???] his mother.
 
2 8:6. And esau seeing that his father had blessed [???] [???] and had sent 
him into [???]ia of [???] [???] to marry a wife thence; and that after 
the blessing he had charged him [???] saying: thou shalt not take a wife of 
the daughters of [???]:
 
2 8:7. And that [???]b [???]ying his parents [???] was gone into [???]:
 
2 8:8. [???]cing also [???] that his father was not well pleased with the 
daughters of [???]:
 
2 8:9. He went to [???] [???] and took to wife [???] besides them he had before [???] 
[???] [???] the daughter of [???] [???] [???]s's son [???] the sister of [???].
 
2 8:10. But [???]b being departed from [???] [???] went on to [???].
 
2 8:11. And when he was come to a certain place [???] and would rest in it 
after [???] [???] he took of the stones that lay there [???] and putting under 
his head [???] slept in the same place.
 
2 8:12. And he saw in his sleep a ladder standing upon the earth [???] and the 
top thereof touching heaven: the angels also of god [???]ding and 
[???]ding by it.
 
2 8:13. And the lord leaning upon the ladder saying to him: i am the lord 
god of [???]ham thy father [???] and the god of [???]: the land [???] wherein thou 
[???] [???] i will give to thee and to thy seed.
 
2 8:14. And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth: thou shalt spread 
abroad to the west [???] and to the east [???] and to the north [???] and to the south:
and in thee and thy seed [???] all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed.
 
2 8:15. And i will be thy keeper whithersoever thou goest [???] and will bring 
thee back into this land: neither will i leave thee [???] till i shall have 
[???]ished all that i have said.
 
2 8:16. And when [???]b awaked out of sleep [???] he said: indeed the lord is 
in this place [???] and i knew it not.
 
2 8:17. And trembling [???] he said: how terrible is this place? this is no 
other but the house of god [???] and the gate of heaven.
 
2 8:18. And [???]b arising in the morning [???] took the stone which he had 
laid under his head [???] and set it up for a title [???] pouring oil upon the top 
of it.
 
2 8:19. And he called the name of the city [???] [???] which before was 
called [???].
 
[???]... This name signifies the house of god.
 
2 8:20. And he made a vow [???] saying: if god shall be with me [???] and shall 
keep me in the way [???] by which i walk [???] and shall give me bread to eat [???] and 
raiment to put on [???] 
 
2 8:21. And i shall return prosperously to my father's house: the lord 
shall be my god:
 
2 8:22. And this stone [???] which i have set up for a title [???] shall be called 
the house of god: and of all things that thou shalt give to me [???] i will 
offer [???]es to thee.

[???]b serveth [???]an seven years for [???]: but is deceived with [???]: he 
afterwards [???]eth [???].@@lia bears him four sons.
 
2 9:1. Then [???]b went on in his journey [???] and came into the east country.
 
2 9:2. And he saw a well in the field [???] and three flocks of sheep lying by 
it: for the beasts were watered out of it [???] and the mouth thereof was 
closed with a great stone.
 
2 9:3. And the custom was [???] when all the sheep were [???]ered together [???] to 
roll away the stone [???] and after the sheep were [???] [???] to put it on the 
mouth of the well again.
 
2 9:4. And he said to the [???]: brethren [???] whence are you? they 
answered: of [???].
 
2 9:5. And he asked them [???] saying: know you [???] [???] the son of [???]? they 
said: we know him.
 
2 9:6. He said: is he in health? he is in health [???] say they: and behold [???] 
[???] [???] his daughter [???] cometh with his flock.
 
2 9:7. And [???]b said: there is yet much day remaining [???] neither is it 
time to bring the flocks into the [???]ds again: first give the sheep 
drink [???] and so lead them back to feed.
 
2 9:8. They answered: we cannot [???] till all the cattle be [???]ered
together [???] and we remove the stone from the well's mouth [???] that we may 
water the [???].
 
2 9:9. They were yet speaking [???] and behold [???]el came with her father's 
sheep; for she fed the flock.
 
2 9:10. And when [???]b saw her [???] and knew her to be his cousin german [???] and 
that they were the sheep of [???] [???] his uncle: he removed the stone 
wherewith the well was closed.
 
2 9:11. And having watered the flock [???] he kissed her: and [???]ting up his 
voice wept.
 
2 9:12. And he told her that he was her father's brother [???] and the son of 
[???]: but she went in haste and told her father.
 
2 9:13. Who [???] when he heard that [???]b his sister's son was come [???] ran 
forth to meet him: and embracing him [???] and heartily kissing him [???] brought 
him into his house. And when he had heard the causes of his journey [???] 
 
2 9:14. He answered: thou art my bone and my flesh. And after the days of 
one month were [???] [???] 
 
2 9:15. He said to him: because thou art my brother [???] shalt thou serve me 
without wages? tell me what wages thou wilt have.
 
2 9:16. Now he had two daughters [???] the name of the elder was [???]; and the 
younger was called [???].
 
2 9:17. Butlia was [???]-eyed: [???]el was well favoured [???] and of a 
beautiful countenance.
 
2 9:18. And [???]b being in love with her [???] said: i will serve thee seven 
years for [???] [???] thy younger daughter.
 
2 9:19. [???]an answered: it is better that i give her to thee than to 
another man; stay with me.
 
2 9:20. So [???]b served seven years for [???]: and they seemed but a few 
days [???] because of the greatness of his love.
 
2 9:21. And he said to [???]: give me my wife; for now the time is 
[???] [???] that i may go in unto her.
 
2 9:22. And he [???] having invited a great number of his friends to the 
feast [???] made the marriage.
 
2 9:23. And at night he brought in [???] [???] his daughter [???] to him [???] 
 
2 9:24. Giving his daughter a [???] [???] named [???]. Now when [???]b had 
gone in to her according to custom [???] when morning was come he saw it was 
[???].
 
2 9:25. And he said to his father-in-law: what is it that thou didst mean 
to do? did not i serve thee for [???]? why hast thou deceived me?
 
2 9:26. [???]an answered: it is not the custom in this place [???] to give the 
younger in marriage first.
 
2 9:27. Make up the week of days of this match: and i will give thee her 
also [???] for the service that thou shalt render me other seven years.
 
2 9:28. He yielded to his pleasure: and after the week was past [???] he 
married [???]:
 
2 9:29. To whom her father gave [???] [???] for her servant.
 
2 9:30. And having at length [???]ained the marriage he wished for [???] he 
preferred the love of the latter before the former [???] and served with him 
other seven years.
 
2 9:31. And the lord seeing that he despised [???] [???] opened her womb [???] but 
her sister remained barren.
 
2 9:32. And she conceived and bore a son [???] and called his name [???] [???] 
saying: the lord saw my affliction: now my husband will love me.
 
2 9:33. And again she conceived and bore a son [???] and said: because the 
lord heard that i was despised [???] he hath given this also to me: and she 
called his name [???].
 
2 9:34. And she conceived the third time [???] and bore another son [???] and said:
now also my husband will be joined to me [???] because i have borne him three 
sons: and therefore she called his name [???].
 
2 9:35. The fourth time she conceived and bore a son [???] and said: now will 
i praise the lord: and for this she called him [???]. And she left 
bearing.

[???] [???] being barren [???] delivereth her handmaid to [???]; she beareth two 
sons.@@lia ceasing to bear [???] giveth also her [???] [???] and she beareth two 
more. Thenlia beareth other two sons and one daughter. [???]el beareth
joseph. [???] [???] [???]rous to return home [???] is hired to stay for a certain 
part of the flock's increase [???] whereby he becometh exceeding rich.
 
3 0:1. And [???]el seeing herself without children [???] envied her sister [???] and 
said to her husband: give me children [???] otherwise i shall die.
 
3 0:2. And [???]b being angry with her [???] answered: am i as god [???] who hath 
[???]ived thee of the fruit of thy womb?
 
3 0:3. But she said: i have here my servant [???]: go in unto her [???] that 
she may bear upon my knees [???] and i may have children by her.
 
3 0:4. And she gave him ba in marriage: who [???] 
 
3 0:5. When her husband had gone in unto her [???] conceived and bore a son.
 
3 0:6. And [???]el said: the lord hath judged for me [???] and hath heard my 
voice [???] giving me a son; and therefore she called his name [???].
 
3 0:7. And again ba [???] [???] and bore another [???] 
 
3 0:8. For whom [???]el said: god hath compared me with my sister [???] and i 
have [???]: and she called him [???].
 
3 0:9.@@lia perceiving that she had left of bearing [???] gave [???] [???] her 
[???] [???] to her husband.
 
3 0:10. And when she had [???] [???] and brought forth a son [???] 
 
3 0:11. She said: happily. And therefore called his name gad.
 
3 0:12. [???]a also bore another.
 
3 0:13. Andlia said: this is for my happiness: for women will call me 
blessed. Therefore she called him [???].
 
3 0:14. And ruben going out in the time of the wheat harvest into the 
field [???] found [???]: which he brought to his mother [???]. And [???]el
said: give me part of thy son's [???].
 
3 0:15. She answered: dost thou think it a small matter [???] that thou hast 
taken my husband from me [???] unless thou take also my son's [???]?
[???]el said: he shall sleep with thee this night [???] for thy son's 
[???].
 
3 0:16. And when [???]b returned at even from the field [???]lia went out to 
meet him [???] and said: thou shalt come in unto me [???] because i have hired
thee for my son's [???]. And he slept with her that night.
 
3 0:17. And god heard her prayers; and she [???]: and bore a fifth 
son:
 
3 0:18. And said: god hath given me a reward [???] because i gave my handmaid
to my husband. And she called his name [???].
 
3 0:19. Andlia conceived again [???] and bore the sixth son [???] 
 
3 0:20. And said: god hath endowed me with a good dowry; this turn also 
my husband will be with me [???] because i have borne him six sons: and 
therefore she called his name [???].
 
3 0:21. After whom she bore a daughter [???] named [???].
 
3 0:22. The lord also remembering [???] [???] heard her [???] and opened her womb.
 
3 0:23. And she [???] [???] and bore a son [???] saying: god hath taken away my 
reproach.
 
3 0:24. And she called his name joseph: saying: the lord give me also 
another son.
 
3 0:25. And when joseph was born [???] [???]b said to his father-in-law: send 
me away [???] that i may return into my country [???] and to my land.
 
3 0:26. Give me my wives [???] and my children [???] for whom i have served thee [???] 
that i may depart: thou knowest the service that i have rendered thee.
 
3 0:27. [???]an said to him: let me find favour in thy sight: i have 
learned [???] by experience [???] that god hath blessed me for thy sake.
 
3 0:28. Appoint thy wages which i shall give thee.
 
3 0:29. But he answered: thou knowest how i have served thee [???] and how 
great thy possession hath been in my hands.
 
3 0:30. Thou hadst but little before i came to thee [???] and now thou art 
become rich: and the lord hath blessed thee at my coming. It is 
reasonable [???] therefore [???] that i should now provide also for my own house.
 
3 0:31. And [???]an said: what shall i give thee? but he said: i require 
nothing; but if thou wilt do what i demand [???] i will feed and keep thy 
sheep again.
 
3 0:32. Go round through all thy [???] [???] and separate all the sheep of 
divers colours [???] and [???]; and all that is brown and spotted [???] and of 
divers colours [???] as well among the sheep as among the [???] [???] shall be my 
wages.
 
3 0:33. And my justice shall answer for me tomorrow before thee [???] when the 
time of the bargain shall come; and all that is not of divers colours [???] 
and spotted [???] and brown [???] as well among the sheep as among the [???] [???] 
shall accuse me of theft.
 
3 0:34. And [???]an said: i like well what thou [???].
 
3 0:35. And he separated the same day the she-[???] [???] and the sheep [???] and 
the he-[???] [???] and the rams of divers colours [???] and spotted; and all the 
flock of one colour [???] that is [???] of white and black [???] [???] he delivered 
into the hands of his sons.
 
3 0:36. And he set the space of three days journey betwixt himself and 
his son-in-law [???] who fed the rest of his flock.
 
3 0:37. And [???]b took green rods of [???] [???] and of [???] [???] and of [???]-
trees [???] and pilled them in part: so when the bark was taken off [???] in the 
parts that were [???] [???] there appeared [???]: but the parts that 
were whole [???] remained green: and by this means the colour was divers.
 
3 0:38. And he put them in the [???] [???] where the water was poured out;
that when the flocks should come to drink [???] they might have the rods
before their eyes [???] and in the sight of them might conceive.
 
3 0:39. And it came to pass [???] that in the very heat of [???] [???] the sheep 
beheld the [???] [???] and brought forth spotted [???] and of divers colours [???] and 
[???].
 
3 0:40. And [???]b separated the flock [???] and put the rods in the [???]s
before the eyes of the [???]; and all the white and the black were 
[???]'s [???] and the rest were [???]'s [???] when the flocks were separated one 
from the other.
 
3 0:41. So when the ewes went first to ram [???] [???]b put the rods in the 
[???]s of water before the eyes of the [???] [???] and of the [???] [???] that they 
might conceive while they were looking upon them.
 
3 0:42. But when the later coming was [???] and the last [???] [???] he did 
not put them. And those that were [???] [???] became [???]'s; and they of 
the first time [???] [???]'S.
 
3 0:43. And the man was enriched exceedingly [???] and he had many [???] [???] 
maid-servants and men-servants [???] camels and [???].
 
[???]is chapter 31
 
[???]s's departure: he is pursued and overtaken by [???]. They make a 
[???].
 
3 1:1. But after that he had heard the words of the sons of [???] [???] 
saying: [???]b hath taken away all that was our father's [???] and being 
enriched by his substance is become great.
 
3 1:2. And perceiving also [???] that [???]s's countenance was not towards him 
as yesterday and the other day.
 
3 1:3. Especially the lord saying to him: return into the land of thy 
fathers and to thy kindred [???] and i will be with thee.
 
3 1:4. He sent [???] and called [???]el andlia into the field [???] where he fed 
the [???] [???] 
 
3 1:5. And said to them: i see your father's countenance is not towards 
me as yesterday and the other day: but the god of my father hath been 
with me.
 
3 1:6. And you know that i have served your father to the uttermost of my 
power.
 
3 1:7. Yea your father hath also [???]ached me [???] and hath changed my 
wages ten times: and yet god hath not suffered him to hurt me.
 
3 1:8. If at any time [???] he said: the [???]led shall be thy wages: all the 
sheep brought forth [???]: but when he said on the contrary: thou 
shalt take all the white one for thy wages: all the flocks brought forth 
white ones.
 
3 1:9. And god hath taken your father's substance [???] and given it to me.
 
3 1:10. For after the time came of the ewes [???] [???] i lifted up my 
eyes [???] and saw in my sleep [???] that the males which [???]ped upon the females
were of divers colours [???] and spotted [???] and [???].
 
3 1:11. And the angel of god said to me in my sleep: [???]. And i 
answered: here i am.
 
3 1:12. And he said: lift up thy eyes [???] and see that all the males [???]ping
upon the [???] [???] are of divers colours [???] spotted and [???]. For i 
have seen all that [???]an hath done to thee.
 
3 1:13. I am the god of [???] [???] where thou didst [???]int the stone [???] and 
make a vow to me. Now therefore arise [???] and go out of this land [???] and 
return into thy native country.
 
3 1:14. And [???]el andlia answered: have we any thing left among the 
goods and inheritance of our father's house?
 
3 1:15. Hath he not counted us as strangers [???] and sold us [???] and eaten up 
the price of us?
 
3 1:16. But god hath taken our father's riches [???] and delivered them to us [???] 
and to our children: wherefore [???] do all that god hath commanded thee.
 
3 1:17. Then [???]b rose up [???] and having set his children and wives upon 
[???] [???] went his way.
 
3 1:18. And he took all his substance [???] and [???] [???] and whatsoever he had 
gotten in [???] [???] and went forward to [???] [???] his father [???] to the 
land of [???].
 
3 1:19. At that time [???]an was gone to shear his sheep [???] and [???]el stole 
away her father's [???].
 
Her father's [???]... By this it appears that [???]an was an [???]; and 
some of the fathers are of opinion that [???]el stole away these [???]ls to 
withdraw him from [???] [???] removing the occasion of his sin.
 
3 1:20. And [???]b would not confess to his father-in-law that he was 
flying away.
 
3 1:21. And when he was gone [???] together with all that [???]ged to him [???] and 
having passed the river [???] was going on towards mount [???] [???] 
 
3 1:22. It was told [???]an on the third day [???] that [???]b fled.
 
3 1:23. And he took his brethren with him [???] and pursued after him seven 
days; and overtook him in the mount of [???].
 
3 1:24. And he saw in a dream god [???] saying to him: take heed thou speak 
not any thing harshly against [???].
 
3 1:25. Now [???]b had pitched his tent in the mountain: and when he [???] with 
his brethren [???] had overtaken him [???] he pitched his tent in the same mount 
of [???].
 
3 1:26. And he said to [???]: why hast thou done thus [???] to carry away [???] 
without my knowledge [???] my daughters as captives taken with the sword?
 
3 1:27. Why wouldst thou run away [???] [???] and not acquaint me [???] that i 
might have brought thee on the way with joy [???] and with songs [???] and with 
[???] [???] and with [???]?
 
3 1:28. Thou hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and daughters; thou 
hast done [???]; and now indeed [???] 
 
3 1:29. It is in my power to return thee evil; but the god of your father 
said to me yesterday: take heed thou speak not any thing harshly against 
[???].
 
3 1:30. Suppose thou didst desire to go to thy friends [???] and hadst a 
longing after thy father's house: why hast thou stolen away my gods?
 
3 1:31. [???]b answered: that i departed unknown to thee [???] it was for fear 
lest thou wouldst take away thy daughters by force.
 
3 1:32. But [???] whereas [???] thou chargest me with theft: with whomsoever thou 
shalt find thy gods [???] let him be slain before our brethren. Search [???] and 
if thou find any of thy things with me [???] take them away. Now when he said 
this [???] he knew not that [???]el had stolen the [???].
 
3 1:33. So [???]an went into the tent of [???] [???] and of [???] [???] and of both the 
[???] [???] and found them not. And when he was entered into [???]s's 
tent [???] 
 
3 1:34. She [???] in haste [???] hid the [???]ls under the [???]s's furniture [???] and sat 
upon them: and when he had [???]ched all the tent [???] and found nothing [???] 
 
3 1:35. She said: let not my lord be angry that i cannot rise up before 
thee [???] because it has now happened to me according to the custom of 
women. So his careful search was in vain.
 
3 1:36. And [???]b being angry [???] said in a chiding manner: for what fault 
of mine [???] and for what offence on my part hast thou so hotly pursued me [???] 
 
3 1:37. And [???]ched all my household stuff? what hast thou found of all 
the substance of thy house? lay it here before my brethren [???] and thy 
brethren [???] and let them judge between me and thee.
 
3 1:38. Have i [???] therefore [???] been with thee twenty years? thy ewes and 
goats were not barren [???] the rams of thy flocks i did not eat:
 
3 1:39. Neither did i shew thee that which the beast had torn; i made 
good all the [???]: whatsoever was lost by theft [???] thou didst exact it 
of me:
 
3 1:40. Day and night was i parched with heat [???] and with frost [???] and sleep 
departed from my eyes.
 
3 1:41. And in this manner have i served thee in thy house twenty years [???] 
fourteen for thy daughters [???] and six for thy [???]: thou hast changed 
also my wages ten times.
 
3 1:42. Unless the god of my father [???] [???] [???] and the fear of [???] [???] had 
stood by me [???] peradventure now thou hadst sent me away naked: god beheld 
my affliction and the labour of my hands [???] and rebuked thee yesterday.
 
3 1:43. [???]an answered him: the daughters are mine [???] and the children [???] and 
thy [???] [???] and all things that thou seest are mine: what can i do to my 
children [???] and [???]?
 
3 1:44. Come [???] therefore [???] let us enter into a league; that it may be for a 
testimony between me and thee.
 
3 1:45. And [???]b took a stone [???] and set it up for a title.
 
3 1:46. And he said to his brethren: bring hither stones. And they [???] 
[???]ering stones together [???] made a heap [???] and they ate upon it.
 
3 1:47. And [???]an called it [???] the witness heap; and [???] [???] the [???]lock of 
testimony: each of them according to the [???]iety of his language.
 
3 1:48. And [???]an said: this heap shall be a witness between me and thee 
this day [???] and therefore the name thereof was called [???] [???] that is [???] the 
witness heap.
 
3 1:49. The lord behold and judge between us [???] when we shall be gone one 
from the other.
 
3 1:50. If thou afflict my daughters [???] and if thou bring in other wives 
over them: none is witness of our speech but god [???] who is present and 
[???].
 
3 1:51. And he said again to [???]: behold this heap [???] and the stone which 
i have set up between me and thee [???] 
 
3 1:52. Shall be a witness: this heap [???] i say [???] and the stone [???] be they for 
a testimony [???] if either i shall pass beyond it going towards thee [???] or 
thou shalt pass beyond it thinking harm to me.
 
3 1:53. The god of [???] [???] and the god of [???] [???] the god of their 
father [???] judge between us. And [???]b swore by the fear of his father 
[???]:
 
3 1:54. And after he had offered sacrifices in the mountain [???] he called 
his brethren to eat bread. And when they had eaten [???] they lodged there:
 
3 1:55. But [???]an arose in the night [???] and kissed his sons and daughters [???] 
and blessed them: and returned to his place.
 
[???]is chapter 32
 
[???]s's vision of angels; his message and presents to [???]; his 
[???]tling with an angel.
 
3 2:1. [???]b also went on the journey he had begun: and the angels of god 
met him.
 
3 2:2. And when he saw them [???] he said: these are the camps of god [???] and he 
called the name of that place [???] [???] that is [???] camps.
 
3 2:3. And he sent messengers before him to [???] [???] his brother [???] to the 
land of [???] [???] to the country of [???]:
 
3 2:4. And he commanded them [???] saying: thus shall ye speak to my lord 
[???]: thus saith thy brother [???]: i have [???]ned with [???] [???] and 
have been with him until this day:
 
3 2:5. I have [???] [???] and [???] [???] and sheep [???] and men-servants [???] and 
women-servants: and
