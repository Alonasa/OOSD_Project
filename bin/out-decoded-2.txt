History 
 
 
This e-text comes fromple editions ofner's revised douay-
ms version of the holy bible. In 1568 english exiles [???] many from 
oxford [???] established the english colle of douay (i [???] doway) [???]ers [???] 
under william (later cardinal) allen. Inber [???] 1578 [???] gregory martin 
began the work of preparing an english translation of the bible for 
lic readers [???] the first such translation into modern english.
assisting were william allen [???] richardow [???] thomaston [???] and 
williamds who revised [???]ized [???] and corrected dr. Martin's 
work. The colle published the new testament atms (ms [???]es) [???] 
france [???] in 1582 through johnny with a preface andatory notes [???] 
authored chiefly by bristol [???] allen [???] andton. Later the old 
testament was published at douay in two parts (1609 and 1610) by laurence
am through the efforts of dr.@@ton [???] then superior of the 
inary. The translation had been prepared before the appearance of the 
new testament [???] but the publication was delayed due toial
difficulties. The religious and scholarlyerence to the latin vulgate
text led to the lessant andatic words and phrases often found 
in the translation. In some instances where no english word conveyed the 
full meaning of the latin [???] a latin word wasized and its meaning 
defined in a glossary. Although ridiculed byics [???] many of these 
words later found common usage in the english language. Spellings of 
proper names and the numbering of the ps are adopted from the latin
vulgate.
 
In 1749 dr. Richardner began a major revision of the douay and 
ms texts [???] the spellings and phrasing of which had become increasingly
arc in the almost twories since the translations were first 
produced. He mod the diction and introduced a moreid style [???] 
while faithfully maintaining the accuracy of dr. Martin's texts. This 
revision became the'de facto'standard text for english speaking 
ics until the twentieth century. It is still highly regarded by 
many for its style [???] although it is now rarely used forical
purposes. The notes included in this elec edition are generally 
attributed to bishopner.

The book ofis
 
This book is so called from its treating of the generation [???] that is [???] 
of the creation and the beginning of the world. Thews call it 
ith [???] from the word with which it begins. It contains not only 
the history of the creation of the world; but also an account of its 
progress during the space of 2369 years [???] that is [???] until the death of 
joseph.
 
 
@@is chapter 1
 
God createth heaven and earth [???] and all things therein [???] in six days.
 
1:1. In the beginning god created heaven [???] and earth.
 
1:2. And the earth was void and empty [???] and darkness was upon the face of 
the deep; and the spirit of god moved over the waters.
 
1:3. And god said: be light made. And light was made.
 
1:4. And god saw the light that it was good; and he divided the light 
from the darkness.
 
1:5. And he called the light day [???] and the darkness night; and there was 
evening and morning one day.
 
1:6. And god said: let there be a firmament madest the waters: and 
let it divide the waters from the waters.
 
A firmament... By this name is here understood the whole space between 
the earth [???] and the highest stars. The lower part of which divideth the 
waters that are upon the earth [???] from those that are above in the clouds.
 
1:7. And god made a firmament [???] and divided the waters that were under 
the firmament [???] from those that were above the firmament [???] and it was so.
 
1:8. And god called the firmament [???] heaven; and the evening and morning 
were the second day.
 
1:9. God also said; let the waters that are under the heaven [???] be 
gathered together into one place: and let the dry land appear. And it 
was so done.
 
1:10. And god called the dry land [???] earth; and the gathering together of 
the waters [???] he called seas. And god saw that it was good.
 
1:11. And he said: let the earth bring forth green herb [???] and such as may 
seed [???] and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind [???] which may have 
seed in itself upon the earth. And it was so done.
 
1:12. And the earth brought forth the green herb [???] and such as yieldeth
seed according to its kind [???] and the tree that beareth fruit [???] having seed 
each one according to its kind. And god saw that it was good.
 
1:13. And the evening and the morning were the third day.
 
1:14. And god said: let there be lights made in the firmament of heaven [???] 
to divide the day and the night [???] and let them be for signs [???] and for 
seasons [???] and for days and years:
 
1:15. To shine in the firmament of heaven [???] and to give light upon the 
earth [???] and it was so done.
 
1:16. And god made two great lights: a greater light to rule the day;
and a lesser light to rule the night: and the stars.
 
Two great lights... God created on the first day [???] light [???] which being 
moved from east to west [???] by its rising and setting [???] made morning and 
evening. But on the fourth day he ordered and distributed this light [???] 
and made the sun [???] moon [???] and stars. The moon [???] though much less than the 
stars [???] is here called a great light [???] from its giving a far greater light 
to the earth than any of them.
 
1:17. And he set them in the firmament of heaven to shine upon the 
earth.
 
1:18. And to rule the day and the night [???] and to divide the light and the 
darkness. And god saw that it was good.
 
1:19. And the evening and morning were the fourth day.
 
1:20. God also said: let the waters bring forth the creeping creature 
having life [???] and the fowl that may fly over the earth under the 
firmament of heaven.
 
1:21. And god created the great whales [???] and every living and moving 
creature [???] which the waters brought forth [???] according to their kinds [???] and 
every winged fowl according to its kind. And god saw that it was good.
 
1:22. And he blessed them [???] saying: increase andly [???] and fill the 
waters of the sea: and let the birds belied upon the earth.
 
1:23. And the evening and morning were the fifth day.
 
1:24. And god said: let the earth bring forth the living creature in its 
kind [???] cattle and creeping things [???] and beasts of the earth [???] according to 
their kinds. And it was so done.
 
1:25. And god made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds [???] and 
cattle [???] and every thing that creepeth on the earth after its kind. And 
god saw that it was good.
 
1:26. And he said: let us make man to our image and likeness: and let 
him have dominion over the fishes of the sea [???] and the fowls of the air [???] 
and the beasts [???] and the whole earth [???] and every creeping creature that 
moveth upon the earth.
 
Let us make man to our image... This image of god in man [???] is not in the 
body [???] but in the soul; which is a spiritual substance [???] endued with 
understanding and free will. God speaketh here in the plural number [???] to 
insinuate theality of persons in the deity.
 
1:27. And god created man to his own image: to the image of god he 
created him: male and female he created them.
 
1:28. And god blessed them [???] saying: increase andly [???] and fill the 
earth [???] and subdue it [???] and rule over the fishes of the sea [???] and the fowls
of the air [???] and all living creatures that move upon the earth.
 
Increase andly... This is not a precept [???] as some protestant
ists would have it [???] but a blessing [???] rendering them fruitful;
for god had said the same words to the fishes [???] and birds [???] (ver. 22) who 
were incapable of receiving a precept.
 
1:29. And god said: behold i have given you every herb bearing seed upon 
the earth [???] and all trees that have in themselves seed of their own kind [???] 
to be your meat:
 
1:30. And to all beasts of the earth [???] and to every fowl of the air [???] and 
to all that move upon the earth [???] and wherein there is life [???] that they 
may have to feed upon. And it was so done.
 
1:31. And god saw all the things that he had made [???] and they were very 
good. And the evening and morning were the sixth day.
 
@@is chapter 2
 
God resteth on the seventh day and blesseth it. The earthly paradise [???] in 
which god placeth man. He commandeth him not to eat of the tree of 
knowledge. And formeth a woman of his rib.
 
2:1. So the heavens and the earth were finished [???] and all the furniture 
of them.
 
2:2. And on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made: and he 
rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.
 
He rested [???] etc... That is [???] he ceased to make or create any new kinds of 
things. Though [???] as our lord tells us [???] john 5. 17 [???] [???] he still worketh [???] [???] 
viz. [???] byving and governing all things [???] and creating souls.
 
2:3. And he blessed the seventh day [???] and sanctified it: because in it he 
had rested from all his work which god created and made.
 
2:4. These are the generations of the heaven and the earth [???] when they 
were created [???] in the day that the lord god made the heaven and the 
earth:
 
2:5. And every plant of the field before it sprung up in the earth [???] and 
every herb of the ground before it grew: for the lord god had not rained
upon the earth; and there was not a man to till the earth.
 
2:6. But a spring rose out of the earth [???] watering all the surface of the 
earth.
 
2:7. And the lord god formed man of the slime of the earth: and breathed 
into his face the breath of life [???] and man became a living soul.
 
2:8. And the lord god had planted a paradise of pleasure from the 
beginning: wherein he placed man whom he had formed.
 
2:9. And the lord god brought forth of the ground all manner of trees [???] 
fair to behold [???] and pleasant to eat of: the tree of life also in the 
midst of paradise: and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
 
The tree of life... So called because it had that quality [???] that by 
eating of the fruit of it [???] man would have been preserved in a constant 
state of health [???] vigour [???] and strength [???] and would not have died at all.
the tree of knowledge... To which the deceitful serpent falsely 
attributed the power of imparting a superior kind of knowledge [???] beyond 
that which god was pleased to give.
 
2:10. And a river went out of the place of pleasure to water paradise [???] 
which from thence is divided into four heads.
 
2:11. The name of the one is phison: that is it which compasseth all the 
land ofath [???] where gold groweth.
 
2:12. And the gold of that land is very good: there is foundium [???] 
and thex stone.
 
2:13. And the name of the second river ison: the same is it that 
compasseth all the land ofia.
 
2:14. And the name of the third river is tigris: the same passeth along 
by the as. And the fourth river isates.
 
2:15. And the lord god took man [???] and put him into the paradise of 
pleasure [???] to dress it [???] and to keep it.
 
2:16. And he commanded him [???] saying: of every tree of paradise thou shalt 
eat:
 
2:17. But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil [???] thou shalt not eat.
for in what daysoever thou shalt eat of it [???] thou shalt die the death.
 
2:18. And the lord god said: it is not good for man to be alone: let us 
make him a help like unto himself.
 
2:19. And the lord god having formed out of the ground all the beasts of 
the earth [???] and all the fowls of the air [???] brought them to adam to see 
what he would call them: for whatsoever adam called any living creature 
the same is its name.
 
2:20. And adam called all the beasts by their names [???] and all the fowls
of the air [???] and all the cattle of the field: but for adam there was not 
found a helper like himself.
 
2:21. Then the lord god cast a deep sleep upon adam: and when he was 
fast asleep [???] he took one of his ribs [???] and filled up flesh for it.
 
2:22. And the lord god built the rib which he took from adam into a 
woman: and brought her to adam.
 
2:23. And adam said: this now is bone of my bones [???] and flesh of my 
flesh; she shall be called woman [???] because she was taken out of man.
 
2:24. Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother [???] and shall cleave to 
his wife: and they shall be two in one flesh.
 
2:25. And they were both naked: to wit [???] adam and his wife: and were not 
ashamed.
 
@@is chapter 3
 
The serpent's craft. The fall of our first parents. Their punishment.
the promise of a redeemer.
 
3:1. Now the serpent was more subtle than any of the beasts of the earth 
which the lord god had made. And he said to the woman: why hath god 
commanded you [???] that you should not eat of every tree of paradise?
 
3:2. And the woman answered him [???] saying: of the fruit of the trees that 
are in paradise we do eat:
 
3:3. But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of paradise [???] god 
hath commanded us that we should not eat; and that we should not touch 
it [???] lest perhaps we die.
 
3:4. And the serpent said to the woman: no [???] you shall not die the death.
 
3:5. For god doth know that in what daysoever you shall eat thereof [???] 
your eyes shall be opened: and you shall be as gods [???] knowing good and 
evil.
 
3:6. And the woman saw that the tree was good to eat [???] and fair to the 
eyes [???] and delightful to behold: and she took of the fruit thereof [???] and 
did eat [???] and gave to her husband [???] who did eat.
 
3:7. And the eyes of them both were opened: and when they perceived 
themselves to be naked [???] they sewed together fig leaves [???] and made 
themselves aprons.
 
And the eyes [???] etc... Not that they were blind before [???] (for the woman saw 
that the tree was fair to the eyes [???] ver. 6.) nor yet that their eyes 
were opened to any more perfect knowledge of good; but only to the 
unhappy experience of having lost the good of original grace and 
innocence [???] and incurred the dreadful evil of sin. From whence followed a 
shame of their being naked; which they minded not before; because being 
now stript of original grace [???] they quickly began to be subject to the 
shameful rebellions of the flesh.
 
3:8. And when they heard the voice of the lord god walking in paradise 
at the afternoon air [???] adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of 
the lord god [???]st the trees of paradise.
 
3:9. And the lord god called adam [???] and said to him: where art thou?
 
3:10. And he said: i heard thy voice in paradise; and i was afraid [???] 
because i was naked [???] and i hid myself.
 
3:11. And he said to him: and who hath told thee that thou wast naked [???] 
but that thou hast eaten of the tree whereof i commanded thee that thou 
shouldst not eat?
 
3:12. And adam said: the woman [???] whom thou gavest me to be my companion [???] 
gave me of the tree [???] and i did eat.
 
3:13. And the lord god said to the woman: why hast thou done this? and 
she answered: the serpent deceived me [???] and i did eat.
 
3:14. And the lord god said to the serpent: because thou hast done this 
thing [???] thou art cursed among all cattle [???] and beasts of the earth: upon 
thy breast shalt thou go [???] and earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy 
life.
 
3:15. I will put enmities between thee and the woman [???] and thy seed and 
her seed: she shall crush thy head [???] and thou shalt lie in wait for her 
heel.
 
She shall crush...@@a [???] the woman; so divers of the fathers read this 
place [???]ably to the latin: others read itum [???] viz. [???] the seed.
the sense is the same: for it is by her seed [???] jesus christ [???] that the 
woman crushes the serpent's head.
 
3:16. To the woman also he said: i willly thy sorrows [???] and thy 
ions: in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children [???] and thou shalt 
be under thy husband's power [???] and he shall have dominion over thee.
 
3:17. And to adam he said: because thou hastened to the voice of 
thy wife [???] and hast eaten of the tree [???] whereof i commanded thee [???] that 
thou shouldst not eat [???] cursed is the earth in thy work: with labour and 
toil shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy life.
 
3:18. Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee [???] and thou shalt 
eat the herbs of the earth.
 
3:19. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to 
the earth out of which thou wast taken: for dust thou art [???] and into dust 
thou shalt return.
 
3:20. And adam called the name of his wife eve: because she was the 
mother of all the living.
 
3:21. And the lord god made for adam and his wife garments of skins [???] and 
clothed them.
 
3:22. And he said: behold adam is become as one of us [???] knowing good and 
evil: now therefore lest perhaps he put forth his hand and take also of 
the tree of life [???] and eat [???] and live for ever.
 
Behold adam [???] etc... This was spoken by way of reproaching him with his 
pride [???] in affecting a knowledge that might make him like to god.
 
3:23. And the lord god sent him out of the paradise of pleasure [???] to till 
the earth from which he was taken.
 
3:24. And he cast out adam: and placed before the paradise of pleasure 
ms [???] and a flaming sword [???] turning every way [???] to keep the way of 
the tree of life.

The history of cain andabel.
 
4:1. And adam knew eve his wife; who conceived and brought forth cain [???] 
saying: i have gotten a man through god.
 
4:2. And again she brought forth his brotherabel. Andabel was a 
shepherd [???] and cain a husbandman.
 
4:3. And it came to pass after many days [???] that cain offered [???] of the 
fruits of the earth [???] gifts to the lord.
 
4:4.@@abel also offered of the firstlings of his flock [???] and of their fat:
and the lord had respect toabel [???] and to his offerings.
 
Had respect... That is [???]ed his acceptance of his sacrifice (as 
coming from a heart full of devotion): and that [???] as we may suppose [???] by 
some visible token [???] such as sending fire from heaven upon his offerings.
 
4:5. But to cain and his offerings he had no respect: and cain was 
exceeding angry [???] and his countenance fell.
 
4:6. And the lord said to him: why art thou angry? and why is thy 
countenance fallen?
 
4:7. If thou do well [???] shalt thou not receive? but if ill [???] shall not sin 
forthwith be present at the door? but the lust thereof shall be under 
thee [???] and thou shalt have dominion over it.
 
4:8. And cain said toabel his brother: let us go forth abroad. And when 
they were in the field [???] cain rose up against his brotherabel [???] and slew 
him.
 
4:9. And the lord said to cain: where is thy brotherabel? and he 
answered: i know not: am i my brother's keeper?
 
4:10. And he said to him: what hast thou done? the voice of thy 
brother's blood crieth to me from the earth.
 
4:11. Now therefore cursed shalt thou be upon the earth [???] which hath 
opened her mouth and received the blood of thy brother at thy hand.
 
4:12. When thou shalt till it [???] it shall not yield to thee its fruit: a 
itive and aond shalt thou be upon the earth.
 
4:13. And cain said to the lord: my iniquity is greater than that i may 
deserve pardon.
 
4:14. Behold thou dost cast me out this day from the face of the earth [???] 
and from thy face i shall be hid [???] and i shall be aond and a 
itive on the earth: every one therefore that findeth me [???] shall kill 
me.
 
Every one that findeth me shall kill me... His guilty conscience made 
him fear his own brothers and nephews; of whom [???] by this time [???] there might 
be a good number upon the earth; which had now endured near 130 years;
as may be gathered from gen. 5. 3 [???] compared with chap. 4. 25 [???] though in 
theious account given in theures [???] only cain andabel are 
mentioned.
 
4:15. And the lord said to him: no [???] it shall not so be: but whosoever
shall kill cain [???] shall be punished sevenfold. And the lord set a mark 
upon cain [???] that whosoever found him should not kill him.
 
Set a mark [???] etc... The more common opinion of the interpreters of holy 
writ supposes this mark to have been a trembling of the body; or a 
horror and con in his countenance.
 
4:16. And cain went out from the face of the lord [???] and dwelt as a 
itive on the earth at the east side of eden.
 
4:17. And cain knew his wife [???] and she conceived [???] and brought forth 
ch: and he built a city [???] and called the name thereof by the name of 
his sonch.
 
His wife... She was a daughter of adam [???] and cain's own sister; god 
sing with such marriages in the beginning of the world [???] as mankind 
could not otherwise beated. He built a city [???] viz... In process of 
time [???] when his race waslied [???] so as to beerous enough to 
people it. For in the many hundred years he lived [???] his race might be 
lied even to millions.
 
4:18. Andch begot irad [???] and irad begotael [???] andael begot 
ael [???] andael begot lamech [???] 
 
4:19. Who took two wives: the name of the one wasa [???] and the name of 
the other sella.
 
4:20. Anda brought forth jabel: who was the father of such as dwell 
in tents [???] and ofmen.
 
4:21. And his brother's name wasal: he was the father of them that 
play upon the harp and the organs.
 
4:22. Sella also brought forthain [???] who was a hammer and 
ar in every work of brass and iron. And the sister ofain
wasa.
 
4:23. And lamech said to his wivesa and sella: hear my voice [???] ye 
wives of lamech [???] hearken to my speech: for i have slain a man to the 
wounding of myself [???] and a stripling to my own bruising.
 
I have slain a man [???] etc... It is the tradition of thews [???] that 
lamech in hunting slew cain [???] mistaking him for a wild beast; and that 
having discovered what he had done [???] he beat soifully the youth [???] 
by whom he was led into that mistake [???] that he died of the blows.
 
4:24. Sevenfold vengeance shall be taken for cain: but for lamech
seventy times sevenfold.
 
4:25. Adam also knew his wife again: and she brought forth a son [???] and 
called his name seth [???] saying: god hath given me another seed forabel [???] 
whom cain slew.
 
4:26. But to seth also was born a son [???] whom he called enos: this man 
began to call upon the name of the lord.
 
Began to call upon [???] etc... Not that adam and seth had not called upon 
god [???] before the birth of enos; but that enos used more solemnity in the 
worship and in of god.

Man's sin is the cause of the de. Noe is commanded to build theark.
 
6:1. And after that men began to belied upon the earth [???] and 
daughters were born to them [???] 
 
6:2. The sons of god seeing the daughters of men [???] that they were fair [???] 
took to themselves wives of all which they chose.
 
The sons of god... The descendants of seth and enos are here called sons 
of god from their religion and piety: whereas thely race of cain [???] 
who by theiral affections lay grovelling upon the earth [???] are called 
the children of men. The unhappy consequence of the former marrying with 
the latter [???] ought to be a warning to christians to be verypect
in their marriages; and not to suffer themselves to be determined in 
their choice by theiral passion [???] to the pre of virtue or 
religion.
 
6:3. And god said: my spirit shall not remain in man for ever [???] because 
he is flesh [???] and his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.
 
His days shall be [???] etc... The meaning is [???] that man's days [???] which before 
the flood were usually 900 years [???] should now be reduced to 120 years. Or 
rather [???] that god would allow men this term of 120 years [???] for their 
repentance and conversion [???] before he would send the de.
 
6:4. Now giants were upon the earth in those days. For after the sons of 
god went in to the daughters of men [???] and they brought forth children [???] 
these are the mighty men of old [???] men of renown.
 
Giants... It is likely the generality of men before the flood were of a 
antic stature in comparison with what men now are. But these here 
spoken of are called giants [???] as being not only tall in stature [???] but 
violent and savage in their dispositions [???] and mere monsters of cruelty 
and lust.
 
6:5. And god seeing that the wickedness of men was great on the earth [???] 
and that all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil at all times [???] 
 
6:6. It repented him that he had made man on the earth. And being 
touched inwardly with sorrow of heart [???] 
 
It repented him [???] etc... God [???] who isable [???] is not capable of 
repentance [???] grief [???] or any other passion. But these expressions are used 
to declare the enormity of the sins of men [???] which was so provoking as to 
determine their creator to destroy these his creatures [???] whom before he 
had so much favoured.
 
6:7. He said: i will destroy man [???] whom i have created [???] from the face of 
the earth [???] from man even to beasts [???] from the creeping thing even to the 
fowls of the air [???] for it repenteth me that i have made them.

iniquity.

had corrupted its way upon the earth) [???] 
 
6:13. He said to noe: the end of all flesh is come before me [???] the earth 
is filled with iniquity through them [???] and i will destroy them with the 
earth.

theark [???] and thou shalt pitch it within and without.
 
6:15. And thus shalt thou make it. The length of theark shall be three 
hundred cubits: the breadth of it fifty cubits [???] and the height of it 
thirty cubits.
 
Three hundred cubits [???] etc... Theark [???] according to theions here 
set down [???] contained four hundred and fifty thousand square cubits; which 
was more than enough to contain all the kinds of living creatures [???] with 
all necessary provisions: even supposing the cubits here spoken of to 
have been only a foot and a half each [???] which was the least king of 
cubits.
 
6:16. Thou shalt make a window in theark [???] and in a cubit shalt thou 
finish the top of it: and the door of theark thou shalt set in the 
side: with lower [???] middle chambers [???] and third stories shalt thou make it.
 
6:17. Behold [???] i will bring the waters of a great flood upon the earth [???] 
to destroy all flesh [???] wherein is the breath of life under heaven. All 
things that are in the earth shall be consumed.

into theark [???] thou and thy sons [???] and thy wife [???] and the wives of thy sons 
with thee.
 
6:19. And of every living creature of all flesh [???] thou shalt bring two of

the female.
 
6:20. Of fowls according to their kind [???] and of beasts in their kind [???] and

return to thee at this same time [???] life accompanying [???] and sara shall have

wicked?
 
18:24. If there be fifty just men in the city [???] shall they perish withal?
and wilt thou not spare that place for the sake of the fifty just [???] if 
they be therein?
 
18:25. Far be it from thee to do this thing [???] and to slay the just with 
the wicked [???] and for the just to be in like case as the wicked; this is 
not beseeming thee: thou who judgest all the earth [???] wilt not make this 
judgment.

the city [???] i will spare the whole place for their sake.

speak to my lord [???] whereas i am dust and ashes.

five and forty destroy the whole city: and he said: i will not destroy 
it [???] if i find five and forty.

thou do? he said: i will not destroy it for the sake of forty.

thirty shall be found there? he answered: i will not do it [???] if i find 
thirty there.

upon them: and when he had searched all the tent [???] and found nothing [???] 
 
31:35. She said: let not my lord be angry that i cannot rise up before 
thee [???] because it has now happened to me according to the custom of 
women. So his careful search was in vain.
 
31:36. Andb being angry [???] said in a chiding manner: for what fault 
of mine [???] and for what offence on my part hast thou so hotly pursued me [???] 
 
31:37. And searched all my household stuff? what hast thou found of all 
the substance of thy house? lay it here before my brethren [???] and thy 
brethren [???] and let them judge between me and thee.
 
31:38. Have i [???] therefore [???] been with thee twenty years? thy ewes and 
goats were not barren [???] the rams of thy flocks i did not eat:
 
31:39. Neither did i shew thee that which the beast had torn; i made 
good all the damage: whatsoever was lost by theft [???] thou didst exact it 
of me:
 
31:40. Day and night was i parched with heat [???] and with frost [???] and sleep 
departed from my eyes.
 
31:41. And in this manner have i served thee in thy house twenty years [???] 
fourteen for thy daughters [???] and six for thy flocks: thou hast changed 
also my wages ten times.
 
31:42. Unless the god of my father [???]ham [???] and the fear ofac [???] had 
stood by me [???] peradventure now thou hadst sent me away naked: god beheld 
my affliction and the labour of my hands [???] and rebuked thee yesterday.

thy flocks [???] and all things that thou seest are mine: what can i do to my 
children [???] and gran?
 
31:44. Come [???] therefore [???] let us enter into a league; that it may be for a 
testimony between me and thee.
 
31:45. Andb took a stone [???] and set it up for a title.
 
31:46. And he said to his brethren: bring hither stones. And they [???] 
gathering stones together [???] made a heap [???] and they ate upon it.

testimony: each of them according to theiety of his language.

this day [???] and therefore the name thereof was calledad [???] that is [???] the 
witness heap.
 
31:49. The lord behold and judge between us [???] when we shall be gone one 
from the other.
 
31:50. If thou afflict my daughters [???] and if thou bring in other wives 
over them: none is witness of our speech but god [???] who is present and 
beholdeth.
 
31:51. And he said again tob: behold this heap [???] and the stone which 
i have set up between me and thee [???]

thou shalt pass beyond it thinking harm to me.

ac: o lord who saidst to me [???] return to thy land [???] and to the place of 
thy birth [???] and i will do well for thee.
 
32:10. I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies [???] and of thy truth 
which thou hast fulfilled to thy servant. With my staff i passed over 
thisan; and now i return with two companies.
 
32:11. Deliver me from the hand of my brother esau [???] for i am greatly 
afraid of him; lest perhaps he come [???] and kill the mother with the 
children.
 
32:12. Thou didst say [???] that thou wouldst do well by me [???] andly my

space between drove and drove.

and he ask thee: whose art thou? or whither goest thou? or whose are 
these before thee?
 
32:18. Thou shalt answer: thy servantb's: he hath sent them as a 
present to my lord esau; and he cometh after us.

that followed the droves [???] saying: speak ye the same words to esau [???] when 
ye find him.
 
32:20. And ye shall add: thy servantb himself also followeth after 
us; for he said: i will appease him with the presents that go before [???] 
and afterwards i will see him [???] perhaps he will be gracious to me.

12. 4. He is called god [???] ver. 28 and 30 [???] because he represented the 
person of the son of god. This wrestling [???] in whichb [???] assisted by 
god [???] was a match for an angel [???] was so ordered (ver. 28 [???]) that he might 
learn by this experiment of the divine assistance [???] that neither esau [???] 
nor any other man [???] should have power to hurt him.-it was also spiritual [???] 
as appeareth by his earnest prayer [???] urging and at last obtaining the 
angel's blessing.

sinew of his thigh [???] and forthwith it shrank.
 
32:26. And he said to him: let me go [???] for it is break of day. He 
answered: i will not let thee go [???] except thou bless me.
 
32:27. And he said: what is thy name? he answered:b.

if thou hast been strong against god [???] how much more shalt thou prevail 
against men?
 
32:29.@@b asked him: tell me by what name art thou called? he 
answered: why dost thou ask my name? and he blessed him in the same 
place.
